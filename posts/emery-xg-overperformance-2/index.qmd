Recap of part one with link.

Introduce part two questions. 

Emery by club (show with and without Emery stats).

*emery vs not emery csv*

*emery teams stacked bar chart...need to fix*

Player finishing.

*emery top overperformers total, by match, by shot, by minute. per 90 seems good. compare with not emery?*

Goalkeeper psxG.

*emery goalkeeper overperformance total, by match, by shot, by minute*

Emery by game state versus all by game state.

*side by side bar chart*

Mixed effects regression model.

GD to PPG model (linear).

*scatterplot*

Emery versus predicted points.

*emery stints csv*

Emery scoreline distribution.

*column charts*

Conclusion: Exceeding xG yes, exceeding GD no. Players, maybe. Introduce next part: How predictive is this? Build a model respecting chronology, and validate by using it to predict xG overperformance this season.
