As a football nerd, I love playing around on the [Club Elo](http://clubelo.com) website. One little feature I noticed is that each club's page shows their highest rating, and when they most recently had that rating. So it got me wondering: which British teams have reached #1 in the Elo rankings?

We know which British teams have been champions of Europe: Celtic, Manchester United, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa, Chelsea and Manchester City. But that doesn't necessarily mean reaching #1; Villa, for example, only reached a ranking of 6th in the early 80s despite winning the English league title and the European Cup back-to-back. Why so low? Because Villa had finished no better than 7th in the previous three seasons, and finished 11th the following year - still the lowest ever league position for any team that became European champions.

Villa fans won't care of course, because the only real thing about sport is winning games and winning trophies. The notion of being a "good team" is a completely abstract concept. Nonetheless, I like the Club Elo ratings as they provide an objective measure to compare teams, and they generally pass the sniff test: whenever I look at the latest ratings, they seem about right.

At first I was going to entitle this article "Which British teams have been the best in the world?" But of course, the Club Elo ratings don't include teams outside Europe, which arguably wouldn't affect the top teams today but certainly would have at various points in history. Even if the data included results from South American club football, would there be enough crossover between the two continents to make meaningful combined ratings? Doubtful.

Before I look at the British number ones, I think it's interesting to see which countries have dominated across each era.

*The Club Elo rankings begin at the start of 1940, although it's not clear how the first set of ratings are devised, or how much inter-league mixing there was prior to the start of the European Cup era in 1955. Certainly there were international club competitions such as the Latin Cup and Mitropa Cup (check these) as well as various club friendlies. Famously, (Wolves champions of the world story).*

Spanish teams of course had the advantage in the early 1940s that everyone else was busy fighting World War 2. Once that conflict was decided, Italy took over top spot with the great Torino side reigning for more than two years before the tragic plane crash that killed their entire team in 1949.

*Malmo!? Champs 1949, 1950, 1951, 1953. Runners-up 1946, 1948, 1952. Is this fair? I have no idea.*

*1950s: Austria (Rapid Vienna & Austria Vienna), Hungary (MTK & Honved), long dominance by Spain (Real Madrid & Barcelona; mostly RM) in early European Cup era (1955-1956 first season) finally broken by Italy (first Milan, then Inter) Hungary then RM. Finally Inter in 1965. First British era begins with Celtic in 1968 then Leeds through early 70s, then Dutch in mid 70s (total football!) and England in late 70s before the Germans take over in early 80s (Hamburg & Bayern). England back on top but derailed by the Heysel ban. 1990s, the Italian decade with great Ajax side sneaking in. 2000s, England and Spain. 2010s, mostly Spain with some Germany and Barcelona. What % of this decade was Guardiola #1? Work it out!! 2020s, England.*

## 12. Nottingham Forest: 14 Days

*October 1979*

It's one of the most ridiculous runs in football history. Brian Clough, having already won the league with unheralded Derby County in 1972, took Nottingham Forest to promotion from the second division, to English champions, to European champions then European champions again in four consecutive seasons between 1976-77 and 1979-80. They also won the league cup in 1978 and 1979. Despite this success, Forest only briefly reached number one of the Elo rankings in October 1979, such was the dominance of their rivals Liverpool during this era.

## 11. Tottenham Hotspur: 18 Days

*January 1985*

It may not be a surprise that Spurs have reached the top of the rankings, but it's a surprise *when* this happened. The all-time great Spurs side of the 1960s actually never made it to the top spot, as English teams still had to catch up on the great European sides like Real Madrid and Benfica. But Spurs did sneak into top spot in January 1985.

Having won the 1984 UEFA Cup Final against a strong Anderlecht side who themselves reached #1 that year, Spurs began the 1984-1985 season well and topped the table going into the new year after winning at local rivals Arsenal. But Everton put together an incredible run of 16 wins and two draws from 18 matches to surge to the title and also take Spurs' short-lived Elo #1 ranking. 

## 10. Hibernian: 26 Days

*1951-1952*

With all due respect, I was not expecting to see Hibs on this list. 

## 9. Arsenal: *???* Days

*1971, 1991, 2004, 2025-2026*

Although Arsenal have reached #1 at four different times in their history, it is actually the current side that has been there the longest. In 1971, despite winning the double, they only reached the top spot for a total of 14 days, and in 1991 despite hosing up for the title they only managed two days at the top, as English football's stock had fallen dramatically during the Heysel ban. For all his domestic success at Arsenal, Arsene Wenger never cracked Europe, and he only reached #1 for four days in 2004. So it is Arteta, with a current run of *xxx* days that doesn't look like ending any time soon, who has by far the longest spell in top spot. Can he now add the trophies to match?

## 8. Aberdeen: 166 Days

*1983-1984*

Alex Ferguson's name is now synonymous with Manchester United's most successful era, but his time at Aberdeen was fairly insane as well. He took over in 1978 and led them to league finishes of 4-1-2-2-3-1-1-4, as well as winning four Scottish FA Cups and the 1983 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup where they beat Real Madrid in the final. The Dons topped the rankings for 152 straight days between November 1983 and April 1984; a good effort in the middle of the dominant English era.

## 7. Everton: 378 Days

*1969-1970, 1985-1987*

1960s, very consistent, did not do much in Europe. Champions 1970. Lean period then 1984 FA Cup, champions 1985 and CWC winners (and lost in FA Cup final! one of the all-time great runs of results bearing in mind fixtures), runners up 1986 with Lineker, champions 1987. Not allowed to enter European Cup. 

## 6. Celtic: 533 Days

*1968-1972*

Famous 1967 team but continued being great until 1972. Champions from 1965-66 to 1973-74 (nine seasons). European Cup winners 1967 (30 miles Glasgow etc), QF 69 (champs Milan), runners-up 70 (to Feyenoord in 117th min) QF 71 (champs Ajax), SF 72 (Inter on pens).

## 5. Leeds United: 575 Days

*1969-1971, 1973-1974*

The great unheralded team of English football. Champions 69. Euro semis 70. Runners-up 71 to Arsenal, big collapse (see article/table). FA Cup 72. CWC RU 73. Champs 74. European Cup runners-up 75. Talk about the near-misses.

# 4. Chelsea: 664 Days

*2004-2009*

New money. Only four top 4 finishes prior to PL era, one FA Cup. When Abramovich took over, one championship ever. Since Abramovich, 5 titles, 5 FA Cups, 3 league cups, 2 CL, 2 EL, 2 Club world cup for whatever they are worth. Frame it as "before Roman" and "after Roman". Golden era under Mourinho, Avram Grant and Scolari? Check dates. Rafa Benitez the nemesis in Europe.

Nothing since 2009 is surprising tbh, given money spent.

## 3. Manchester United: 992 Days

*1999-2003, 2007-2009*

Champs 1967, EC winners 1968, why not #1? Quickly drifted down the league, not champs until 1993. #1 1999 when CL winners. 2nd era arguably the greatest team, Rooney & Ronaldo.

## 2. Manchester City: 1,127 Days

*2021-2024*

New money. Much like Chelsea, a before-Abu Dhabi and after-Abu Dhabi era. Prior to 2008 they had two league titles (1937 - relegated next year! - and 1968) and hadn't won anything since league cup 1976. Since AD, 8 leagues, 3 FA Cups, 6 league cups, CL, club world cup.

## 1. Liverpool: 3,481 Days

*1972-1974, 1976-1980, 1982, 1984-1991, 2009, 2019-2020, 2022, 2024-2025*

The best by MILES. Shanks started it. Win everything 70s and 80s, dueling with Forest and Everton. Surprisingly hit #1 in April 2009 for four days under Rafa, then Klopp era.
