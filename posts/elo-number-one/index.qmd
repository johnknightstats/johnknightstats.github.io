As a football nerd, I love playing around on the [Club Elo](http://clubelo.com) website. One thing I noticed is that each club's page shows their highest rating, and when they most recently had that rating. So it got me wondering: which British teams have reached #1 in the Elo rankings?

We know which teams have been champions of Europe: Celtic, Manchester United, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa, Chelsea and Manchester City. But that doesn't necessarily mean reaching #1; Villa, for example, only reached a ranking of 6th in the early 80s despite winning the English league title and the European Cup back-to-back. *Explain why...came out of nowhere and disappeared again...only 10th in the year they won EC...is that the lowest of any team?*

Introduce Club Elo as a fun and somewhat effective measure. Best in the world? Elo doesn't include South American teams which would have been an interesting debate until recently but not enough crossover.

Dominant eras by country. Start: Spain. How was this decided? 1940s: Spain, Italy (Torino: plane crash), Malmo!? 1950s: Austria, Italy, Scotland, Spain, Hungary. European Cup era (1955-1956 first season): Hungary then RM. Finally Inter in 1965. 1968 Scotland (Celtic) then the English era 1970s and 1980s. Ajax & Bayern early 1970s plus Feyenoord & Gladbach. Germany good in the 80s too! Then 90s, Italy. 2010s: Guardiola!? See if you can work out what % his teams were #1.

Start from #12 Forest...

12. Nottingham Forest

*1979*

It's one of the most ridiculous runs in football history. Brian Clough, having already won the league with unheralded Derby County, took Nottingham Forest to promotion from the second division, to English champions, to European champions then European champions again in four consecutive seasons between 1976-77 and 1979-80. They also won the league cup in 1978 and 1979.

Forest only briefly reached number one of the Elo rankings in October 1979, such was the dominance of their rivals Liverpool during this era. 

11. Tottenham Hotspur

*1985*

It's not a surprise that Spurs have reached the top of the rankings, but it's a surprise *when* this happened. The all-time great Spurs side of the 60s never made it to the top spot - the dominance of Real Madrid during that era made it difficult. But Tottenham did sneak into top spot in January 1985.

You would think 1960s but no! Some great 1980s sides but often undone by heavy schedule/injuries instead of peaking once.

10. Hibernian

*1951-1952*

Wait what?

9. Arsenal

*1971, 1991, 2004, 2025-2026*

Cunts.

8. Aberdeen

*1983-1984*

Fergie, wow. Broke the Auld Firm stranglehold. Joined in summer of 1978. 4-1-2-2-3-1-1-4. Won 4 Scottish Cups and the Cup Winners' Cup.

7. Everton

*1969-1970, 1985-1987*

Quality in 60s and 80s

6. Celtic

*1968-1971*

Famous 1967 team but continued being great until 1972

5. Leeds

*1969-1974*

The great unheralded team of English football.

4. Chelsea

*2004-2009*

New money

3. Man Utd

*1999-2003, 2007-2009*

Then and now.

2. Man City

*2021-2022*

New money

1. Liverpool

*1972-1991, 2009, 2022-2025*
