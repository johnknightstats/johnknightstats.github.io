As a football nerd, I love playing around on the [Club Elo](http://clubelo.com) website. One little feature I noticed is that each club's page shows their highest rating, and when they most recently had that rating. So it got me wondering: which British teams have reached #1 in the Elo rankings?

We know which British teams have been champions of Europe: Celtic, Manchester United, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa, Chelsea and Manchester City. But that doesn't necessarily mean reaching #1; Villa, for example, only reached a ranking of 6th in the early 80s despite winning the English league title and the European Cup back-to-back. Why so low? Villa had finished no better than 7th in the previous three seasons, and finished 11th the following year - still the lowest ever league position for any team that became European champions.

Villa fans won't care of course, because the only real thing about sport is winning games and winning trophies. The notion of being a "good team" is a completely abstract concept. Nonetheless, I like the Club Elo ratings as they provide an objective measure to compare teams, and they generally pass the sniff test: whenever I look at the latest ratings, they seem about right.

At first I was going to entitle this article "Which British teams have been the best in the world?" But of course, the Club Elo ratings don't include teams outside Europe, which arguably wouldn't affect the top teams today but certainly would have at various points in history. Even if the data included results from South American club football, would there be enough crossover between the two continents to make meaningful combined ratings? Doubtful.

Before I look at the British number ones, I think it's interesting to see which countries have dominated across each era. The pie charts below are colour-coded to show the nationality of the number one team in the rankings in each decade.

The Club Elo rankings begin at the start of 1940. Start: Spain. How was this decided? 2nd world war, unfair advantage to Spain? 1940s: Spain, Italy (Torino: plane crash), Malmo!? 

1950s: Austria, Italy, Scotland, Spain, Hungary. European Cup era (1955-1956 first season): Hungary then RM. Finally Inter in 1965. Dominance of British teams from late 60s through the 70s and 80s although German teams (Hamburg and Bayern) make up a surprising amount of the 1980s. 

The 1990s are undoubtedly the Italian decade. 2010s: Guardiola!? See if you can work out what % his teams were #1.

Start from #12 Forest...

*NEED A LEAGUE TABLE TOOL TO BE ABLE TO MENTION POSITIONS*

12. Nottingham Forest

*October 1979*

It's one of the most ridiculous runs in football history. Brian Clough, having already won the league with unheralded Derby County, took Nottingham Forest to promotion from the second division, to English champions, to European champions then European champions again in four consecutive seasons between 1976-77 and 1979-80. They also won the league cup in 1978 and 1979.

Forest only briefly reached number one of the Elo rankings in October 1979, such was the dominance of their rivals Liverpool during this era. 

11. Tottenham Hotspur

*January 1985*

It's not a surprise that Spurs have reached the top of the rankings, but it's a surprise *when* this happened. The all-time great Spurs side of the 60s never made it to the top spot - the dominance of Real Madrid during that era made it difficult. But Tottenham did sneak into top spot in January 1985.

Anderlecht side they beat in 1984 was unreal.

10. Hibernian

*1951-1952*

Wait what?

9. Arsenal

*1971, 1991, 2004, 2025-2026*

Current stretch is their longest by MILES.

8. Aberdeen

*1983-1984*

Fergie, wow. Broke the Auld Firm stranglehold. Joined in summer of 1978. 4-1-2-2-3-1-1-4. Won 4 Scottish Cups and the Cup Winners' Cup.

7. Everton

*1969-1970, 1985-1987*

Quality in 60s and 80s

6. Celtic

*1968-1972*

Famous 1967 team but continued being great until 1972. Champions from 1965-66 to 1973-74 (nine seasons). European Cup winners 1967 (30 miles Glasgow etc), QF 69 (champs Milan), runners-up 70 (to Feyenoord in 117th min) QF 71 (champs Ajax), SF 72 (Inter on pens).

5. Leeds

*1969-1971, 1973-1974*

The great unheralded team of English football. Champions 69. Euro semis 70. Runners-up 71 to Arsenal, big collapse (see article/table). FA Cup 72. CWC RU 73. Champs 74. European Cup runners-up 75. 

4. Chelsea

*2004-2009*

New money. Only four top 4 finishes prior to PL era, one FA Cup. When Abramovich took over, one championship ever. Since Abramovich, 5 titles, 5 FA Cups, 3 league cups, 2 CL, 2 EL, 2 Club world cup for whatever they are worth. Frame it as "before Roman" and "after Roman". Golden era under Mourinho, Avram Grant and Scolari? Check dates. Rafa Benitez the nemesis in Europe.

Nothing since 2009 is surprising tbh, given money spent.

3. Man Utd

*1999-2003, 2007-2009*

Champs 1967, EC winners 1968, why not #1? Quickly drifted down the league, not champs until 1993. #1 1999 when CL winners. 2nd era arguably the greatest team, Rooney & Ronaldo.

2. Man City

*2021-2024*

New money. Much like Chelsea, a before-Abu Dhabi and after-Abu Dhabi era. Prior to 2008 they had two league titles (1937 - relegated next year! - and 1968) and hadn't won anything since league cup 1976. Since AD, 8 leagues, 3 FA Cups, 6 league cups, CL, club world cup.

1. Liverpool

*1972-1974, 1976-1980, 1982, 1984-1991, 2009, 2019-2020, 2022, 2024-2025*

The best by MILES. Shanks started it. Win everything 70s and 80s, dueling with Forest and Everton. Surprisingly hit #1 in April 2009 for four days under Rafa, then Klopp era.
