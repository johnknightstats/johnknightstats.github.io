If I asked you to rank the strength of the 20 Premier League teams, how would you do it? Last year's table? Goal difference? Elo? xG? Perhaps you would create a fancy model?

Personally, whenever I want a quick ranking of teams or players in a sporting event, I head straight for the betting markets. Specifically, I look at either Betfair or Pinnacle. 

Why these two? Because they are less restrictive on winning punters, which means their odds carry more useful information.

I thought it would be interesting to see how the betting market's ratings for each of the Premier League teams changed across last season. I chose to use Pinnacle's odds for this project, mainly because they are kept on the wonderful [Football-Data](https://www.football-data.co.uk/) website.

But how can we get ratings for all teams based simply from the odds of matches? Using Python, I created an algorithm that calculates a rolling rating for each team throughout the season. Here's how it works:

1. Ratings are calculated for all 20 teams on any match day of the 2024-2025 season.
2. Pinnacle's Asian handicap line is used as the rating for each match (with an adjustment based on the odds).
3. A uniform home advantage is used from the aggregate of all matches over the season.
4. For each date, matches considered are those on the date itself, plus the game before and game after for each team. So that's 3 games for teams playing on that date, and 2 for the other teams.
5. An optimization is run for this pool of games to minimize the difference with the Asian handicap.
