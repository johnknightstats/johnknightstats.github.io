Fans of Liverpool and Manchester United may wish to proceed with caution.\nIn last season’s Eredivisie, Ajax suffered a dramatic late collapse, winning only one of their last five games to blow a nine point lead over PSV.\nIt got me thinking about England, and which teams historically have had the highest probability of winning the league only to fail at the end - and how would we quantify that?\nI decided to create a model that could give the probability on any date of each team becoming champions."

    "text": "5. Burnley 1961-1962 (Probability: 80.4%)\nIf you had asked me to name every club to have been champions of England, I’ll be honest, Ipswich Town might be one of the trickier ones. But when I scratched beneath the surface, their 1961-1962 win emerges as one of the more fascinating and unexpected championships in football league history.\n\n Ipswich Town 1961-1962. They may look like Al Capone’s henchmen, but these guys were champions of England.\n\nAt the time, Burnley were a true force in English football, having won the league in 1960 and in the midst of a run of 12 consecutive top half finishes. The dominant team of the era were Bill Nicholson’s Spurs, coming off a historic league & cup double the previous season, and this year reaching the European Cup semi-final where they would lose to Benfica.\nThere was also an emerging Everton side who were about to embark on a 10-year stretch where they won two league titles and finished outside the top 6 only once.\nIpswich, meanwhile, were playing in the top flight for the first time in the club’s history under manager Alf Ramsey, a former Spurs right back who learned his trade under Arthur Rowe in Tottenham’s influential “push and run” champions of 1951.\nDespite trailing by a point, on the 14th of April Burnley had two games in hand and as the strongest team were still considered 80% favourites, with the next two games at home to Lancashire rivals Blackburn and Blackpool.\n\n Division One Table on 14 April 1962 (42-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGA\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nIpswich Town\n\n\n38\n\n\n84\n\n\n63\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n50\n\n\n1679\n\n\n19.4\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBurnley\n\n\n36\n\n\n97\n\n\n58\n\n\n1.67\n\n\n49\n\n\n1753\n\n\n80.3\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n37\n\n\n72\n\n\n47\n\n\n1.53\n\n\n43\n\n\n1691\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n36\n\n\n75\n\n\n61\n\n\n1.23\n\n\n43\n\n\n1733\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nSheffield United\n\n\n38\n\n\n56\n\n\n64\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n43\n\n\n1628\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAston Villa\n\n\n37\n\n\n50\n\n\n46\n\n\n1.09\n\n\n39\n\n\n1649\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 6 games to go, Burnley were the best team, with the best goal average, and two games in hand.\n\nOne thing this model doesn’t account for is fixture congestion. Burnley had played an FA Cup semi-final replay on the 9th of April, and faced a staggering 8 further league games in the remainder of the month, including three games in four days.\n\nBurnley’s Closing Results 1961-1962\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 April 1962\n\n\nBlackburn Rovers (H)\n\n\nL\n\n\n0 - 1\n\n\n\n\n20 April 1962\n\n\nBlackpool (H)\n\n\nW\n\n\n2 - 0\n\n\n\n\n21 April 1962\n\n\nSheffield United (A)\n\n\nL\n\n\n0 - 2\n\n\n\n\n23 April 1962\n\n\nBlackpool (A)\n\n\nD\n\n\n1 - 1\n\n\n\n\n28 April 1962\n\n\nChelsea (H)\n\n\nD\n\n\n1 - 1\n\n\n\n\n30 April 1962\n\n\nSheffield Wednesday (A)\n\n\nL\n\n\n0 - 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurgen Klopp would not be amused if you gave him this fixture list.\n\nBurnley’s finish was grim: just one win from their final eight games. Ipswich became 61% favourites after a 3-0 win at Arsenal in their penultimate match, before sealing the championship with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa with star striker Ray Crawford scoring both goals.\n\nDivision One Title Race 1961-1962  Ipswich lost only one of their final 16 league matches.\n\nBurnley still had a game remaining after the title race was over, which they duly lost 4-0 to Sheffield Wednesday, and then to rub salt into the wounds they were beaten by Spurs in the FA Cup Final.\n\nFinal Division One Table 1961-1962\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGA\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nIpswich Town\n\n\n42\n\n\n93\n\n\n67\n\n\n1.39\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBurnley\n\n\n42\n\n\n101\n\n\n67\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n42\n\n\n88\n\n\n69\n\n\n1.28\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n42\n\n\n88\n\n\n54\n\n\n1.63\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nSheffield United\n\n\n42\n\n\n61\n\n\n69\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\n\n42\n\n\n72\n\n\n58\n\n\n1.24\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIpswich won the league in their first ever top flight season.\n\nFor Ipswich, it really seems like they caught lightning in a bottle for that one season. They were thrashed 5-1 by Spurs in the following year’s Charity Shield and lost to AC Milan in the first round of the European Cup.\nBy October 1962, Ramsey had already agreed to take over the England job the following summer, leading them to a World Cup triumph in 1966. Ipswich would end the season in 17th place and then were relegated rock bottom a year later.\nBut this was far from the end of the good times in Suffolk – a decade later, another future England manager named Bobby Robson would oversee a more sustained period of success including an FA Cup, UEFA Cup and league finishes of 4th, 4th, 3rd, 3rd, 3rd, 2nd, 2nd…but not 1st."

Manchester United 1991-1992 (Probability: 80.9%)\nThe 1991-1992 season is often seen as the final year of the old era due to the impending rebrand of Football League Division One to the Premier League. But it was also the final year of Manchester United’s long league title drought since the days of Charlton, Best, and Law in 1967.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, of course, United’s late collapse in 1992 is a mere footnote beneath the outrageous success of the Alex Ferguson era. But what a collapse it was!\nAs the previous year’s champions Arsenal had mounted a disappointing defence of their title and perennial powerhouses Liverpool declined under the disastrous reign of Graeme Souness, the Red Devils found themselves in a commanding position on the 16th of April, two points clear of Leeds United with a game in hand.\nLeeds had only been promoted two years beforehand but had finished a creditable 4th in the previous campaign, and boasted one of those great midfields that is still easy to rattle off today: Speed, McAllister, Batty, Strachan. They also signed a chap called Eric Cantona from Marseille in January, after he was turned down by Souness at Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday couldn’t afford his wages.\n\n Division One Table on 16 April 1992 (42-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester United\n\n\n37\n\n\n58\n\n\n26\n\n\n+32\n\n\n74\n\n\n1800\n\n\n80.9\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nLeeds United\n\n\n38\n\n\n68\n\n\n35\n\n\n+33\n\n\n72\n\n\n1780\n\n\n18.9\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\n\n38\n\n\n58\n\n\n48\n\n\n+10\n\n\n67\n\n\n1715\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n70\n\n\n43\n\n\n+27\n\n\n64\n\n\n1829\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n37\n\n\n44\n\n\n35\n\n\n+9\n\n\n58\n\n\n1764\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n50\n\n\n45\n\n\n+5\n\n\n58\n\n\n1736\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited were expected to win their first league championship since 1967.\n\nThe impact of Cantona at Leeds that season is perhaps overstated (he only made 6 starts, scoring twice) but it remains a remarkable fact that Cantona won the title in every season he played in England other than 1994-1995, when he was suspended from January onwards after attacking a supporter at Selhurst Park.\nWith five games to go, the model gave Manchester United an 81% chance of finally ending their barren run, and even after a 1-1 draw at Luton things were still looking good.\nAnd then the wheels truly came off.\n\nDivision One Title Race 1991-1992  With three successive defeats, United’s chances went from 80% to 0% in the space of one week.\n\nIn a grueling run of fixtures, Fergie’s men contested the League Cup Final on 12 April, defeating Nottingham Forest 1-0, and then played league matches on the 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, and 26th.\nIt was Forest who inflicted the first major defeat, getting revenge for Wembley with a 2-1 win at Old Trafford that sent the title race into coin flip territory. And then, shockingly, United lost 1-0 to a West Ham team that had lost 10 of its last 13 games and would be relegated in bottom place.

Still recovering from the disastrous Hicks-Gillett ownership era, the Reds had only finished 7th, 6th, 8th, and 7th in the previous four campaigns.\nBut Liverpool had a few things that clicked together this year. Thanks to a lack of European football and early domestic cup exits away to Arsenal and Man Utd, Brendan Rodgers’ side only played 43 matches all season compared to 57 each for Man City and Chelsea.\nAnd up front, the emergence of teenager Raheem Sterling alongside Daniel Sturridge and the genuinely world class performances of Luis Suarez electrified a forward line that had until recently included £35m flop Andy Carroll.\n\n Premier League Table on 20 April 2014 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n35\n\n\n96\n\n\n44\n\n\n+52\n\n\n80\n\n\n1916\n\n\n82.2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n35\n\n\n67\n\n\n26\n\n\n+41\n\n\n75\n\n\n1944\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n33\n\n\n88\n\n\n34\n\n\n+54\n\n\n71\n\n\n1949\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n35\n\n\n62\n\n\n41\n\n\n+21\n\n\n70\n\n\n1850\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n35\n\n\n57\n\n\n34\n\n\n+23\n\n\n69\n\n\n1836\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n35\n\n\n51\n\n\n49\n\n\n+2\n\n\n63\n\n\n1803\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool closed in on 100 goals and the title.\n\nFollowing the epic 3-2 win over Man City and an away victory at Norwich by the same score, Liverpool found themselves five points clear of Chelsea and nine clear of City. The model gave them an 82% probability of lifting a first league title since 1990.\nIt would require seven points from the final three games to guarantee the championship, and Liverpool’s prospects were further improved by the fact that Chelsea, with only slim odds of the title themselves and preparing for a crucial Champions League semi-final second leg against Atletico Madrid, decided to rest several key players for the Anfield clash on 27 April (ironically, one of the backups who played as a result was a certain Mohamed Salah).\n\nPremier League Title Race 2013-2014  Liverpool’s defeat to Chelsea was a huge blow, but City’s win at Everton was equally pivotal.\n\nAlas, a Mourinho defensive masterclass ensued, and the surprising 0-2 defeat to Chelsea, including the now infamous slip by Steven Gerrard to gift Demba Ba the opener, sent Liverpool’s odds crashing from 80% to 48%.\n\n One of the iconic Premier League moments.\n\nEqually shocking was the 3-3 draw away to Crystal Palace from a commanding 3-0 lead late on, but perhaps one of the more overlooked results of this stretch was City’s 3-2 victory away to a strong Everton side who finished on 72 points under Roberto Martinez - still their highest total since winning the league themselves in 1987.\nThis win improved City’s title probability by more than 30% - almost the same impact as Liverpool’s loss to Chelsea, but the latter is remembered as being far more decisive.\n\nFinal Premier League Table 2013-2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n102\n\n\n37\n\n\n+65\n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n38\n\n\n101\n\n\n50\n\n\n+51\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n38\n\n\n71\n\n\n27\n\n\n+44\n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n68\n\n\n41\n\n\n+27\n\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n38\n\n\n61\n\n\n39\n\n\n+22\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n55\n\n\n51\n\n\n+4\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, a defence that conceded 50 goals wasn’t quite good enough.\n\nCity closed out the title with routine home wins against Aston Villa and West Ham, and a 4th league championship for the club was secured (they now have ten!).\nMeanwhile, Liverpool would have to continue the wait for #19, and Steven Gerrard ended his otherwise fantastic career with none.

Eight points clear on the 6th of May, the model rated them as 75% favourites before a surprise 2-1 defeat at home to Derby thanks to two goals from future Liverpool striker Dean Saunders.\n\nDivision One Title Race 1988-1989  Liverpool clawed their way back…until the very final hurdle.\n\nWith Liverpool winning 2-1 at Wimbledon on the same day, the odds had flip-flopped, and when the Reds thrashed West Ham 5-1 they entered the final game with a superior GD by four goals. To win the title, Arsenal would need to win by two clear goals in the decider at fortress Anfield, rated by the model as just a 7% probability.\n\n Division One Table on 23 May 1989 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n37\n\n\n65\n\n\n26\n\n\n+39\n\n\n76\n\n\n1916\n\n\n93.1\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n37\n\n\n71\n\n\n36\n\n\n+35\n\n\n73\n\n\n1830\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nNottingham Forest\n\n\n38\n\n\n64\n\n\n43\n\n\n+21\n\n\n64\n\n\n1824\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nNorwich City\n\n\n38\n\n\n48\n\n\n45\n\n\n+3\n\n\n62\n\n\n1715\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nDerby County\n\n\n38\n\n\n40\n\n\n38\n\n\n+2\n\n\n58\n\n\n1704\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n60\n\n\n46\n\n\n+14\n\n\n57\n\n\n1769\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool simply had to avoid defeat by two or more goals at Anfield in the final game.\n\nAnd the rest is history.

While Sergio Aguero’s winner for Manchester City technically came later (93:20, compared with Thomas’ goal at 91:22), the fact that the protagonists were playing head-to-head surely sets this one apart.

If there’s one thing we can learn about teams who blow titles, it’s that the most successful clubs are going to be the ones who give themselves lots of opportunities to mess it up.\nWe’ve covered United’s 1992 collapse, and it feels appropriate to end with 2012 as those two years nicely bookend the dominant Ferguson era.\nI remember watching City fans doing the Poznan during their 6-1 win at Old Trafford and thinking “good for them” - some payback for a lifetime of sitting through garbage while their local rivals win everything. These feelings quickly wore off of course when Abu Dhabi’s billions started hoovering up trophies on an annual basis. But it did feel fresh for a short time.\nThe dramatic nature of Sergio Aguero’s injury time winner in the final game has perhaps allowed many of us to forget just what a commanding position United had allowed to slip away. Eight points clear with six games to go, United had a 95% probability of retaining the Premier League trophy according to the model.\n\n Premier League Table on 9 April 2012 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester United\n\n\n32\n\n\n78\n\n\n27\n\n\n+51\n\n\n79\n\n\n1920\n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n32\n\n\n75\n\n\n26\n\n\n+49\n\n\n71\n\n\n1887\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n32\n\n\n63\n\n\n41\n\n\n+22\n\n\n61\n\n\n1826\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n33\n\n\n57\n\n\n38\n\n\n+19\n\n\n59\n\n\n1796\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nNewcastle United\n\n\n33\n\n\n50\n\n\n42\n\n\n+8\n\n\n59\n\n\n1746\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n33\n\n\n56\n\n\n38\n\n\n+18\n\n\n57\n\n\n1852\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, City manager Roberto Mancini declared that the title race was over.\n\nEven a shock 1-0 defeat at Wigan didn’t seem too terminal, but it was United’s 4-4 draw at home to Everton, having led 4-2 with 10 minutes remaining, that suddenly put City within striking distance as the foes squared off the following week.\nA Vincent Kompany header gave City a 1-0 win, and in the blink of an eye they were 60% favourites.\n\nPremier League Title Race 2011-2012  United opened the door, but City still needed to win all 6 games…which they did.\n\nCity still faced a tricky visit to Newcastle, who ended up 5th under Alan Pardew for their best finish in a decade. A Yaya Toure brace secured the points, and it now seemed like almost a formality that City would beat relegation-threatened QPR in the final game to seal the league.\nBut football can be unpredictable, and QPR found themselves 2-1 up going into injury time, after Joey Barton was sent off and had a meltdown that would result in a 12 match ban.\nUnited did their part, winning at Sunderland, and you all know what happened next of course, with Dzeko equalizing and then Aguero driving home the winner to provoke wild scenes at the Etihad Stadium.\nRemarkably, this means that United’s title-winning probability dropped from 95% to 12%, then back up in the 90s with City trailing, and finally back to zero.

Eventually the relationship was repaired sufficiently for Tevez to return and start the final six games of the season, City winning all six.\n\nFinal Premier League Table 2011-2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n93\n\n\n29\n\n\n+64\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nManchester United\n\n\n38\n\n\n89\n\n\n33\n\n\n+56\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n74\n\n\n49\n\n\n+25\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n66\n\n\n41\n\n\n+25\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nNewcastle United\n\n\n38\n\n\n56\n\n\n51\n\n\n+5\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n38\n\n\n65\n\n\n46\n\n\n+19\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan City’s name at the top was an unusual sight in those days.\n\nAnd so City won the title on goal difference, the only time that has happened in the Premier League era.

    "title": "How does scoring rate change in a football match based on time elapsed and game state?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "John Knight\n\n22 July 2025\n\n\n\nCreating a logistic regression model to predict the chance of scoring a goal in each minute of a football match based on the pre-match odds, current score, minutes elapsed, and any red cards.\n\nWhen is a football team most likely to score? A simple hypothesis would be that the chance of scoring increases as the game goes on, and that teams who are ahead are less likely to score than teams who are behind as they defend their lead. But what do the data say?\nI looked at goal times from the big 5 European leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France) since 2017. Now, a tricky part of goal times in football is injury time. Conventionally, these are often listed as 45’ for a goal in first half injury time and 90’ for second half injury time, so you naturally end up with larger goal totals in these minutes, which will skew the totals and trends.\nAlternatively, you could try and look at injury time minutes individually; but then, how do you know which minutes were actually played, and played in full? I don’t currently have that level of detail, so I decided to ignore injury time goals for the purpose of this analysis, guaranteeing that the 90 minutes considered were all played in full.\nSo firstly, here is a summary of the goals in each of the 90 minutes:\n\n\n\nIt seems like we see the expected upward trend, with understandably low totals at the start of each half as it’s harder to score when each team’s entire XI start in their own half. But what’s that patch of high totals between 48 and 58 minutes? It doesn’t appear to be a data error, but why would there be a stretch of unusually high scoring just after half time like this?\nHere is the same chart but with xG instead of goals. Compared to the previous chart, we can see that the trend is almost identical, but the variance is much lower. I will continue using goals for this particular analysis, but it’s a good demonstration of why xG is so useful in statistical analysis of football.\n\n\n\nSo why does scoring tend to increase as a game progresses? One obvious factor is that every game starts off at 0-0, so the scores are more likely to be level early in games than late in games. Here is a summary of the scoreline by minute:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, for almost the entire first half a level scoreline is most common, and thereafter it is more frequently a one-goal lead for either team. If level games generally play a bit tighter and more defensive than games where one team is leading, then that would explain the lower scoring early in games. When we look at a smoothed plot of scoring rate categorised by lead, we can see that teams with a two-goal lead score at the highest rate, followed by teams with a one-goal lead:\n\n\n\nThe problem here is we have an additional factor: the quality of the teams. If a team is leading by two goals, then it is more likely that they are simply much better than their opponent, and hence more likely to score next. So we need to also account for team strength. I divided all teams into quartiles, based on their pre-match bookmaker odds, with quartile 4 being the strongest teams and quartile 1 being the weakest:\n\n\n\nSo now it’s time to put it all together. The simplest way to estimate the effects of lots of variables when applied simultaneously is with a multiple regression. In this case we will use a logistic regression, since the outcome is binary (0 goals or 1 goal).\nI categorized the current lead with a minimum of “-2 or less” and a maximum of “2 or more”. Additional features in the model were the minute, pre-match odds (converted to probability), and red cards for and against.\nI decided to create separate models for the first and second halves, since the shape of some of the plots suggested it may not be a simple linear relationship for 90 minutes. Based on the low scoring in minutes 1, 2, 46 and 47, I also included flag variables for min1 and min2 of each half.\nFinally, for each half I trained a second model including interactions between lead and minute, lead and pre-match odds, and between lead and red cards for and against. After inspecting the interaction terms’ p-values, plus a likelihood ratio test and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), it seemed like the simpler model was about the same. If in doubt, always stick with the simpler model!\n\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression: First Half\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoefficient\n\n\nStd.

Intercept is only used when making predictions, otherwise that isn’t too relevant.\nEach coefficient represents the associated change in log odds of scoring a goal. Firstly, we can see that teams leading by 1 have a lower coefficient (-0.132) than other scorelines. The first two minutes of the half, as expected, have lower scoring, and then there is a small increase (0.004) for each minute as the half progresses. A red card (-0.766) reduces the chance of scoring more than an opposition red card (0.536) increases it. Predictably, pre-match win probability (1.752) has a strong positive correlation with scoring rate.\n\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression: Second Half\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoefficient\n\n\nStd.

We can also see that the effect of each minute is actually slightly negative now (-0.001).\nTo demonstrate these results, I used the median of each quartile of pre-match odds and predicted each minute of the game with scorelines of -1, 0, and 1, with no red cards:\n\n\n\nSo to summarize our findings:\n\nTeams are relatively more likely to score when trailing than when level, and more likely to score when level than when leading.\nIn the first half, scoring rate increases as the half progresses, all other things being equal.\nWhen the teams come out for the second half, scoring rate jumps higher than it was in the 45th minute, and then decreases slightly as the half progresses.\n\nIf we revisit the first plot in this article, the unusually high values between 48 and 58 minutes now make a little more sense. I have added a red line to the plot which now looks like a slight downward trend in the second half, rather than a series of observations above the overall trend:\n\n\n\nThere are, of course, some limitations to this analysis. Injury time in both halves has been ignored, as have factors like league- or game-specific goal totals. There is also the question of whether goals beget more goals: all other things being equal, does a scoreline of 1-1 tend to predict more goals than a scoreline of 0-0? I may visit these ideas in a future analysis."

    "section": "",
    "text": "John Knight\n\n26 July 2025\n\n\n\nVisualizing rail travel times from the centre of London to surrounding stations with the use of Python, SQLite and the folium package.\n\nRecently, I took a train from Waterloo station to Woking to play a round of golf in Surrey. I’ve taken this route before, and Woking is a relatively easy place to get to because of the abundance of fast trains departing from Waterloo.\n\n Woking: a superstar of the London commuting scene.Picture credit: Kennedy News and Media.\n\nNo doubt this makes Woking a hotbed for London commuters looking to escape the inflated house prices in the capital. But how does Woking’s train service compare with other London satellite towns?\n\nA Project for Python\nI calculated and visualized the travel times to each station in London and the surrounding area using the following steps in Python:\n\nDownload free timetable and station data in JSON format from Network Rail.\nCreate relational tables for schedules and TIPLOCs (railway codes) in SQLite.\nFilter for trains departing from one of the 13 London terminals: Blackfriars, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Euston, Fenchurch Street, King’s Cross, Liverpool Street, London Bridge, Marylebone, Paddington, St. Pancras, Victoria or Waterloo.\nCalculate the mean expected time from a traveller’s arrival at one of the terminals to reaching their destination.\nVisualize the time to each station on a map using the folium library, with green representing a shorter time and red a longer time.\n\nHere is the map:\n\n\n\n\nHow was this calculated?\nLet me expand a little more on the calculation of the times. I wanted a fair way to capture both the frequency and the speed of each train service.\nSuppose you arrive at a London terminal at a random time on a Tuesday between 5:00pm and 7:00pm - typical for someone returning from a day’s work or shopping. You board the next available train with the earliest arrival time at your destination. For example, let’s say I arrived at Waterloo at 5:35pm and the next train to Woking was at 5:40pm. If the train then took 24 minutes to reach Woking (6:04pm arrival) my total elapsed time is 29 minutes.\nI calculated this for each of the 120 minutes (i.e. one simulation per minute) from 5:00pm to 7:00pm and averaged them to get the expected time to each destination.\n\n\nObservations\nIt goes without saying, the general trend is for stations close to the centre of London to have shorter journey times. If you live in Bethnal Green, you’re in luck - it’s less than 10 minutes from Liverpool Street.\nOf course, Bethnal Green is hardly cheap nowadays. The more interesting stations are those further outside London which nonetheless have reasonable expected arrival times. Woking, to the south west of London for those unfamiliar with the home counties, stands out as one of the few solid green dots outside the M25 ringroad.\nMoving clockwise around the outside of the M25, we see similar green dots at Reading, St. Albans, Harpenden, Cheshunt, Broxbourne, Shenfield, Ebbsfleet and Sevenoaks. All these towns have an expected arrival time of less than 33 minutes from arriving at the original station, and might be attractive options for people working in London but looking for more affordable housing.\nSome considerations:\n\nI’m sure the train service to these towns is no secret, and house prices will be higher as a result.\nTrain ticket prices may be higher as you go further outside London.\nLondon Underground stations could be added for a more complete picture.\n\nI may revisit this analysis in future to incorporate house prices, travel cost, and tube stops. Nonetheless, I think it’s an interesting and useful visualization. I hope you agree!\nI welcome feedback! Feel free to contact me at knightjohn2@gmail.com.\n© 2025 John Knight. All rights reserved."
