    "text": "5. Burnley 1961-1962 (Probability: 80.4%)\nIf you had asked me to name every club to have been champions of England, I’ll be honest, Ipswich Town might be one of the trickier ones. But when I scratched beneath the surface, their 1961-1962 win emerges as one of the more fascinating and unexpected championships in football league history.\n\n Ipswich Town 1961-1962. They may look like Al Capone’s henchmen, but these guys were champions of England.\n\nAt the time, Burnley were a true force in English football, having won the league in 1960 and in the midst of a run of 12 consecutive top half finishes. The dominant team of the era were Bill Nicholson’s Spurs, coming off a historic league & cup double the previous season, and this year reaching the European Cup semi-final where they would lose to Benfica.\nThere was also an emerging Everton side who were about to embark on a 10-year stretch where they won two league titles and finished outside the top 6 only once.\nIpswich, meanwhile, were playing in the top flight for the first time in the club’s history under manager Alf Ramsey, a former Spurs right back who learned his trade under Arthur Rowe in Tottenham’s influential “push and run” champions of 1951.\nDespite trailing by a point, on the 14th of April Burnley had two games in hand and as the strongest team were still considered 80% favourites, with the next two games at home to Lancashire rivals Blackburn and Blackpool.\n\n Division One Table on 14 April 1962 (42-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGA\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nIpswich Town\n\n\n38\n\n\n84\n\n\n63\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n50\n\n\n1679\n\n\n19.4\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBurnley\n\n\n36\n\n\n97\n\n\n58\n\n\n1.67\n\n\n49\n\n\n1753\n\n\n80.3\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n37\n\n\n72\n\n\n47\n\n\n1.53\n\n\n43\n\n\n1691\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n36\n\n\n75\n\n\n61\n\n\n1.23\n\n\n43\n\n\n1733\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nSheffield United\n\n\n38\n\n\n56\n\n\n64\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n43\n\n\n1628\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAston Villa\n\n\n37\n\n\n50\n\n\n46\n\n\n1.09\n\n\n39\n\n\n1649\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 6 games to go, Burnley were the best team, with the best goal average, and two games in hand.\n\nOne thing this model doesn’t account for is fixture congestion. Burnley had played an FA Cup semi-final replay on the 9th of April, and faced a staggering 8 further league games in the remainder of the month, including three games in four days.\n\nBurnley’s Closing Results 1961-1962\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 April 1962\n\n\nBlackburn Rovers (H)\n\n\nL\n\n\n0 - 1\n\n\n\n\n20 April 1962\n\n\nBlackpool (H)\n\n\nW\n\n\n2 - 0\n\n\n\n\n21 April 1962\n\n\nSheffield United (A)\n\n\nL\n\n\n0 - 2\n\n\n\n\n23 April 1962\n\n\nBlackpool (A)\n\n\nD\n\n\n1 - 1\n\n\n\n\n28 April 1962\n\n\nChelsea (H)\n\n\nD\n\n\n1 - 1\n\n\n\n\n30 April 1962\n\n\nSheffield Wednesday (A)\n\n\nL\n\n\n0 - 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurgen Klopp would not be amused if you gave him this fixture list.\n\nBurnley’s finish was grim: just one win from their final eight games. Ipswich became 61% favourites after a 3-0 win at Arsenal in their penultimate match, before sealing the championship with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa with star striker Ray Crawford scoring both goals.\n\nDivision One Title Race 1961-1962  Ipswich lost only one of their final 16 league matches.\n\nBurnley still had a game remaining after the title race was over, which they duly lost 4-0 to Sheffield Wednesday, and then to rub salt into the wounds they were beaten by Spurs in the FA Cup Final.\n\nFinal Division One Table 1961-1962\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGA\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nIpswich Town\n\n\n42\n\n\n93\n\n\n67\n\n\n1.39\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBurnley\n\n\n42\n\n\n101\n\n\n67\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n42\n\n\n88\n\n\n69\n\n\n1.28\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n42\n\n\n88\n\n\n54\n\n\n1.63\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nSheffield United\n\n\n42\n\n\n61\n\n\n69\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\n\n42\n\n\n72\n\n\n58\n\n\n1.24\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIpswich won the league in their first ever top flight season.\n\nFor Ipswich, it really seems like they caught lightning in a bottle for that one season. They were thrashed 5-1 by Spurs in the following year’s Charity Shield and lost to AC Milan in the first round of the European Cup.\nBy October 1962, Ramsey had already agreed to take over the England job the following summer, leading them to a World Cup triumph in 1966. Ipswich would end the season in 17th place and then were relegated rock bottom a year later.\nBut this was far from the end of the good times in Suffolk – a decade later, another future England manager named Bobby Robson would oversee a more sustained period of success including an FA Cup, UEFA Cup and league finishes of 4th, 4th, 3rd, 3rd, 3rd, 2nd, 2nd…but not 1st."

Manchester United 1991-1992 (Probability: 80.9%)\nThe 1991-1992 season is often seen as the final year of the old era due to the impending rebrand of Football League Division One to the Premier League. But it was also the final year of Manchester United’s long league title drought since the days of Charlton, Best, and Law in 1967.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, of course, United’s late collapse in 1992 is a mere footnote beneath the outrageous success of the Alex Ferguson era. But what a collapse it was!\nAs the previous year’s champions Arsenal had mounted a disappointing defence of their title and perennial powerhouses Liverpool declined under the disastrous reign of Graeme Souness, the Red Devils found themselves in a commanding position on the 16th of April, two points clear of Leeds United with a game in hand.\nLeeds had only been promoted two years beforehand but had finished a creditable 4th in the previous campaign, and boasted one of those great midfields that is still easy to rattle off today: Speed, McAllister, Batty, Strachan. They also signed a chap called Eric Cantona from Marseille in January, after he was turned down by Souness at Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday couldn’t afford his wages.\n\n Division One Table on 16 April 1992 (42-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester United\n\n\n37\n\n\n58\n\n\n26\n\n\n+32\n\n\n74\n\n\n1800\n\n\n80.9\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nLeeds United\n\n\n38\n\n\n68\n\n\n35\n\n\n+33\n\n\n72\n\n\n1780\n\n\n18.9\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\n\n38\n\n\n58\n\n\n48\n\n\n+10\n\n\n67\n\n\n1715\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n70\n\n\n43\n\n\n+27\n\n\n64\n\n\n1829\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n37\n\n\n44\n\n\n35\n\n\n+9\n\n\n58\n\n\n1764\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n50\n\n\n45\n\n\n+5\n\n\n58\n\n\n1736\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited were expected to win their first league championship since 1967.\n\nThe impact of Cantona at Leeds that season is perhaps overstated (he only made 6 starts, scoring twice) but it remains a remarkable fact that Cantona won the title in every season he played in England other than 1994-1995, when he was suspended from January onwards after attacking a supporter at Selhurst Park.\nWith five games to go, the model gave Manchester United an 81% chance of finally ending their barren run, and even after a 1-1 draw at Luton things were still looking good.\nAnd then the wheels truly came off.\n\nDivision One Title Race 1991-1992  With three successive defeats, United’s chances went from 80% to 0% in the space of one week.\n\nIn a grueling run of fixtures, Fergie’s men contested the League Cup Final on 12 April, defeating Nottingham Forest 1-0, and then played league matches on the 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, and 26th.\nIt was Forest who inflicted the first major defeat, getting revenge for Wembley with a 2-1 win at Old Trafford that sent the title race into coin flip territory. And then, shockingly, United lost 1-0 to a West Ham team that had lost 10 of its last 13 games and would be relegated in bottom place.

Still recovering from the disastrous Hicks-Gillett ownership era, the Reds had only finished 7th, 6th, 8th, and 7th in the previous four campaigns.\nBut Liverpool had a few things that clicked together this year. Thanks to a lack of European football and early domestic cup exits away to Arsenal and Man Utd, Brendan Rodgers’ side only played 43 matches all season compared to 57 each for Man City and Chelsea.\nAnd up front, the emergence of teenager Raheem Sterling alongside Daniel Sturridge and the genuinely world class performances of Luis Suarez electrified a forward line that had until recently included £35m flop Andy Carroll.\n\n Premier League Table on 20 April 2014 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n35\n\n\n96\n\n\n44\n\n\n+52\n\n\n80\n\n\n1916\n\n\n82.2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n35\n\n\n67\n\n\n26\n\n\n+41\n\n\n75\n\n\n1944\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n33\n\n\n88\n\n\n34\n\n\n+54\n\n\n71\n\n\n1949\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n35\n\n\n62\n\n\n41\n\n\n+21\n\n\n70\n\n\n1850\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n35\n\n\n57\n\n\n34\n\n\n+23\n\n\n69\n\n\n1836\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n35\n\n\n51\n\n\n49\n\n\n+2\n\n\n63\n\n\n1803\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool closed in on 100 goals and the title.\n\nFollowing the epic 3-2 win over Man City and an away victory at Norwich by the same score, Liverpool found themselves five points clear of Chelsea and nine clear of City. The model gave them an 82% probability of lifting a first league title since 1990.\nIt would require seven points from the final three games to guarantee the championship, and Liverpool’s prospects were further improved by the fact that Chelsea, with only slim odds of the title themselves and preparing for a crucial Champions League semi-final second leg against Atletico Madrid, decided to rest several key players for the Anfield clash on 27 April (ironically, one of the backups who played as a result was a certain Mohamed Salah).\n\nPremier League Title Race 2013-2014  Liverpool’s defeat to Chelsea was a huge blow, but City’s win at Everton was equally pivotal.\n\nAlas, a Mourinho defensive masterclass ensued, and the surprising 0-2 defeat to Chelsea, including the now infamous slip by Steven Gerrard to gift Demba Ba the opener, sent Liverpool’s odds crashing from 80% to 48%.\n\n One of the iconic Premier League moments.\n\nEqually shocking was the 3-3 draw away to Crystal Palace from a commanding 3-0 lead late on, but perhaps one of the more overlooked results of this stretch was City’s 3-2 victory away to a strong Everton side who finished on 72 points under Roberto Martinez - still their highest total since winning the league themselves in 1987.\nThis win improved City’s title probability by more than 30% - almost the same impact as Liverpool’s loss to Chelsea, but the latter is remembered as being far more decisive.\n\nFinal Premier League Table 2013-2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n102\n\n\n37\n\n\n+65\n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n38\n\n\n101\n\n\n50\n\n\n+51\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n38\n\n\n71\n\n\n27\n\n\n+44\n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n68\n\n\n41\n\n\n+27\n\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n38\n\n\n61\n\n\n39\n\n\n+22\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n55\n\n\n51\n\n\n+4\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, a defence that conceded 50 goals wasn’t quite good enough.\n\nCity closed out the title with routine home wins against Aston Villa and West Ham, and a 4th league championship for the club was secured (they now have ten!).\nMeanwhile, Liverpool would have to continue the wait for #19, and Steven Gerrard ended his otherwise fantastic career with none.

Eight points clear on the 6th of May, the model rated them as 75% favourites before a surprise 2-1 defeat at home to Derby thanks to two goals from future Liverpool striker Dean Saunders.\n\nDivision One Title Race 1988-1989  Liverpool clawed their way back…until the very final hurdle.\n\nWith Liverpool winning 2-1 at Wimbledon on the same day, the odds had flip-flopped, and when the Reds thrashed West Ham 5-1 they entered the final game with a superior GD by four goals. To win the title, Arsenal would need to win by two clear goals in the decider at fortress Anfield, rated by the model as just a 7% probability.\n\n Division One Table on 23 May 1989 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n37\n\n\n65\n\n\n26\n\n\n+39\n\n\n76\n\n\n1916\n\n\n93.1\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n37\n\n\n71\n\n\n36\n\n\n+35\n\n\n73\n\n\n1830\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nNottingham Forest\n\n\n38\n\n\n64\n\n\n43\n\n\n+21\n\n\n64\n\n\n1824\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nNorwich City\n\n\n38\n\n\n48\n\n\n45\n\n\n+3\n\n\n62\n\n\n1715\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nDerby County\n\n\n38\n\n\n40\n\n\n38\n\n\n+2\n\n\n58\n\n\n1704\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n60\n\n\n46\n\n\n+14\n\n\n57\n\n\n1769\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool simply had to avoid defeat by two or more goals at Anfield in the final game.\n\nAnd the rest is history.

If there’s one thing we can learn about teams who blow titles, it’s that the most successful clubs are going to be the ones who give themselves lots of opportunities to mess it up.\nWe’ve covered United’s 1992 collapse, and it feels appropriate to end with 2012 as those two years nicely bookend the dominant Ferguson era.\nI remember watching City fans doing the Poznan during their 6-1 win at Old Trafford and thinking “good for them” - some payback for a lifetime of sitting through garbage while their local rivals win everything. These feelings quickly wore off of course when Abu Dhabi’s billions started hoovering up trophies on an annual basis. But it did feel fresh for a short time.\nThe dramatic nature of Sergio Aguero’s injury time winner in the final game has perhaps allowed many of us to forget just what a commanding position United had allowed to slip away. Eight points clear with six games to go, United had a 95% probability of retaining the Premier League trophy according to the model.\n\n Premier League Table on 9 April 2012 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester United\n\n\n32\n\n\n78\n\n\n27\n\n\n+51\n\n\n79\n\n\n1920\n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n32\n\n\n75\n\n\n26\n\n\n+49\n\n\n71\n\n\n1887\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n32\n\n\n63\n\n\n41\n\n\n+22\n\n\n61\n\n\n1826\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n33\n\n\n57\n\n\n38\n\n\n+19\n\n\n59\n\n\n1796\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nNewcastle United\n\n\n33\n\n\n50\n\n\n42\n\n\n+8\n\n\n59\n\n\n1746\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n33\n\n\n56\n\n\n38\n\n\n+18\n\n\n57\n\n\n1852\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, City manager Roberto Mancini declared that the title race was over.\n\nEven a shock 1-0 defeat at Wigan didn’t seem too terminal, but it was United’s 4-4 draw at home to Everton, having led 4-2 with 10 minutes remaining, that suddenly put City within striking distance as the foes squared off the following week.\nA Vincent Kompany header gave City a 1-0 win, and in the blink of an eye they were 60% favourites.\n\nPremier League Title Race 2011-2012  United opened the door, but City still needed to win all 6 games…which they did.\n\nCity still faced a tricky visit to Newcastle, who ended up 5th under Alan Pardew for their best finish in a decade. A Yaya Toure brace secured the points, and it now seemed like almost a formality that City would beat relegation-threatened QPR in the final game to seal the league.\nBut football can be unpredictable, and QPR found themselves 2-1 up going into injury time, after Joey Barton was sent off and had a meltdown that would result in a 12 match ban.\nUnited did their part, winning at Sunderland, and you all know what happened next of course, with Dzeko equalizing and then Aguero driving home the winner to provoke wild scenes at the Etihad Stadium.\nRemarkably, this means that United’s title-winning probability dropped from 95% to 12%, then back up in the 90s with City trailing, and finally back to zero.

Eventually the relationship was repaired sufficiently for Tevez to return and start the final six games of the season, City winning all six.\n\nFinal Premier League Table 2011-2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n93\n\n\n29\n\n\n+64\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nManchester United\n\n\n38\n\n\n89\n\n\n33\n\n\n+56\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n74\n\n\n49\n\n\n+25\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n66\n\n\n41\n\n\n+25\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nNewcastle United\n\n\n38\n\n\n56\n\n\n51\n\n\n+5\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n38\n\n\n65\n\n\n46\n\n\n+19\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan City’s name at the top was an unusual sight in those days.\n\nAnd so City won the title on goal difference, the only time that has happened in the Premier League era.

    "text": "Visualizing rail travel times from the centre of London to surrounding stations with the use of Python, SQLite and the folium package.\n\nRecently, I took a train from Waterloo station to Woking to play a round of golf in Surrey. I’ve taken this route before, and Woking is a relatively easy place to get to because of the abundance of fast trains departing from Waterloo.\n\n Woking: a superstar of the London commuting scene.Picture credit: Kennedy News and Media.\n\nNo doubt this makes Woking a hotbed for London commuters looking to escape the inflated house prices in the capital. But how does Woking’s train service compare with other London satellite towns?\n\nA Project for Python\nI calculated and visualized the travel times to each station in London and the surrounding area using the following steps in Python:\n\nDownload free timetable and station data in JSON format from Network Rail.\nCreate relational tables for schedules and TIPLOCs (railway codes) in SQLite.\nFilter for trains departing from one of the 13 London terminals: Blackfriars, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Euston, Fenchurch Street, King’s Cross, Liverpool Street, London Bridge, Marylebone, Paddington, St. Pancras, Victoria or Waterloo.\nCalculate the mean expected time from a traveller’s arrival at one of the terminals to reaching their destination.\nVisualize the time to each station on a map using the folium library, with green representing a shorter time and red a longer time.\n\nHere is the map:\n\n\n\n\nHow was this calculated?\nLet me expand a little more on the calculation of the times. I wanted a fair way to capture both the frequency and the speed of each train service.\nSuppose you arrive at a London terminal at a random time on a Tuesday between 5:00pm and 7:00pm - typical for someone returning from a day’s work or shopping. You board the next available train with the earliest arrival time at your destination. For example, let’s say I arrived at Waterloo at 5:35pm and the next train to Woking was at 5:40pm. If the train then took 24 minutes to reach Woking (6:04pm arrival) my total elapsed time is 29 minutes.\nI calculated this for each of the 120 minutes (i.e. one simulation per minute) from 5:00pm to 7:00pm and averaged them to get the expected time to each destination.\n\n\nObservations\nIt goes without saying, the general trend is for stations close to the centre of London to have shorter journey times. If you live in Bethnal Green, you’re in luck - it’s less than 10 minutes from Liverpool Street.\nOf course, Bethnal Green is hardly cheap nowadays. The more interesting stations are those further outside London which nonetheless have reasonable expected arrival times. Woking, to the south west of London for those unfamiliar with the home counties, stands out as one of the few solid green dots outside the M25 ringroad.\nMoving clockwise around the outside of the M25, we see similar green dots at Reading, St. Albans, Harpenden, Cheshunt, Broxbourne, Shenfield, Ebbsfleet and Sevenoaks. All these towns have an expected arrival time of less than 33 minutes from arriving at the original station, and might be attractive options for people working in London but looking for more affordable housing.\nSome considerations:\n\nI’m sure the train service to these towns is no secret, and house prices will be higher as a result.\nTrain ticket prices may be higher as you go further outside London.\nLondon Underground stations could be added for a more complete picture.\n\nI may revisit this analysis in future to incorporate house prices, travel cost, and tube stops. Nonetheless, I think it’s an interesting and useful visualization. I hope you agree! If you want to take a closer look at the code I used for this project, please check out my GitHub repo.\n\nI welcome feedback! Feel free to contact me at knightjohn2@gmail.com.\n© 2025 John Knight.

    "title": "How does scoring rate change in a football match based on time elapsed and game state?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Creating a logistic regression model to predict the chance of scoring a goal in each minute of a football match based on the pre-match odds, current score, minutes elapsed, and any red cards.\n\nWhen is a football team most likely to score? My simple hypothesis would consist of:\n\nThe chance of scoring increases as the game goes on.\nTeams who are ahead are less likely to score than teams who are behind.\n\nBut what does the data say?\nI looked at goal times from the big 5 European leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France) since 2017 - a total of 38,882 goals from 14,357 games.\n\nWhat to do about injury time?\nA tricky part of goal times in football is how to deal with injury time. Conventionally, these are often recorded as 45’ for a goal in first half injury time and 90’ for second half injury time, so you naturally end up with larger goal totals in these minutes, leading to artificial spikes that distort time-based goal patterns.\nIt might be possible to consider each injury time minute individually, but that would require knowing exactly which minutes were played in full, and which were ended after, say, 15 seconds. I don’t currently have that level of detail, so I decided to ignore injury time goals for the purpose of this analysis, guaranteeing that the 90 minutes could all be treated equally.\nFirstly, here is a summary of the goals in each of the 90 minutes:\n\n\n\nAs expected, we see an upward trend, with understandably low totals at the start of each half as it’s harder to score when each team’s entire XI start in their own half of the pitch.\nBut what’s that patch of high totals between 48 and 58 minutes? Why would there be a stretch of unusually high scoring just after half time like this? I double-checked for data errors but it appears to be correct - we will come back to this apparent anomaly a little later.\nNext, here is the same chart but showing expected goals (xG) instead of goals. The trend closely mirrors the goals chart, but with much lower variance. I will continue using goals for this particular analysis, but this is a good demonstration of why xG is so useful in statistical analysis of football: lowering variance is generally a good thing!\n\n\n\n\n\nGame state\nSo why does scoring tend to increase as a game progresses? One obvious factor is that every game starts off at 0-0, and scores are more likely to be level early in games than later on. Here is a summary of the scoreline by minute:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, for almost the entire first half a level scoreline is most common, and thereafter it is more frequently a one-goal lead for either team. If level games are generally tighter and more defensive than games where one team is leading, then that would explain the lower scoring early in games.\nWhen we look at a smoothed plot of scoring rate categorised by lead, we can see that teams with a two-goal lead score at the highest rate, followed by teams with a one-goal lead. (I would ignore the trends for -2 and +2 early in the game, due to small sample issues)\n\n\n\nThe problem here is we have an additional factor: team strength. If a team is leading by two goals, then it is more likely that they are simply a better team than their opponent, and hence more likely to score next. So we need to also account for the quality of the teams.\nI divided all teams into quartiles based on their pre-match bookmaker odds, with quartile 4 containing the strongest teams and quartile 1 the weakest:\n\n\n\n\n\nTime for a regression\nNow let’s bring everything together. The simplest way to estimate the effects of several variables when applied simultaneously is with a multiple regression. In this case we will use a logistic regression, since the outcome is binary (0 goals or 1 goal).\nThe current lead in each minute was categorized with a minimum of “-2 or less” and a maximum of “2 or more”. Additional features in the model were the minute, pre-match odds (converted to probability), and red cards for and against.\nI decided to create separate models for the first and second halves, since the shape of some of the plots suggested it may not be a simple linear relationship for 90 minutes. Based on the low scoring in minutes 1, 2, 46 and 47, I also included dummy variables for minute 1 and minute 2 of each half.\nFinally, for each half I trained a second model including interactions between lead and minute, lead and pre-match odds, and between lead and red cards for and against.

And the Intercept is only used when making predictions, otherwise that isn’t too relevant.\nEach coefficient represents the associated change in log odds of scoring a goal - a positive coefficient means the chances of a goal increase as this variable increases, and vice versa.\nFirstly, we can see that teams leading by 1 have a lower coefficient (-0.132) than the other scorelines. This means teams with a one-goal lead are the least likely to score, all other things being equal.\nThe first two minutes of the half, as expected, have lower scoring, and then there is a small increase (0.004) for each minute as the half progresses. A red card (-0.766) reduces the chance of scoring more than an opposition red card (0.536) increases it. Predictably, pre-match win probability (1.752) is a strong positive predictor of scoring rate.\n\n Logistic Regression: Second Half                       Coefficient       Std.

We can also see that the effect of each additional minute is actually slightly negative now (-0.001).\nTo demonstrate these results, I used the median of each quartile of pre-match odds and predicted each minute of the game with scorelines of -1, 0, and 1, with no red cards:\n\n\n\nIf a strong favourite (white line) was playing against an underdog (dark blue line), we can see that if the favourite were trailing by one goal in the second half, their probability of scoring in each minute would increase significantly more than the associated decrease in the underdog’s chance of scoring. This intuitively feels correct: favourites often ramp up the pressure when chasing an equaliser.\n\n\nSummary of findings\n\nTeams are relatively more likely to score when trailing than when level, and more likely to score when level than when leading.\nIn the first half, scoring rate increases as the half progresses, all other things being equal.\nWhen the teams come out for the second half, scoring rate jumps higher than it was in the 45th minute, and then gradually decreases as the half progresses.\n\n\n\nWhat about those high values in the 48th-58th minute?\nIf we revisit the first plot in this article, the unusually high values between 48 and 58 minutes can now be understood. I have added a red line to the plot which now looks like a slight downward trend in the second half, rather than a series of observations above the overall trend:\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\nThere are, of course, some limitations to this analysis. Injury time in both halves has been ignored, as have factors like league- or game-specific goal totals. There is also the question of whether goals beget more goals: all other things being equal, does a scoreline of 1-1 tend to predict more goals than a scoreline of 0-0?\nThere is plenty more scope to drill down in a future analysis, but this gives us a nice framework to build on.

You develop a new betting system, you get off to a hot start and think you have found the golden goose - but then the wins dry up, and you end up back at square one.\nOne of the trickiest parts of gambling is assessing whether or not you have a genuine edge. It can be easy to get overexcited after some positive early results; but there is also a danger of giving up on a system too early, just because you had an early run of bad luck.\nFor any serious bettor, it’s important to keep a thorough record of all your bets, and an essential part of that process is to record your estimate of the true price for every selection. This enables you to calculate your expected profit at any time, and assess how your actual results are stacking up relative to expectations."

    "section": "Betting distribution tool",
    "text": "Betting distribution tool\nTo help visualize this, I created a simple tool using R Shiny that compares two distribution curves based on the odds, number of bets and your perceived edge. One curve shows how results will be distributed if the market is correct, and the other if your price is correct.\nFor example, let’s say you are placing $100 bets at decimal odds of 2.0, when you believe the true price is 1.8. This means you think there is a 55.6% chance of the bet winning when the market says it is 50%, which is a very solid edge if you can find it consistently.\nAfter 100 bets, the curves look like this:\n\n 100 bets at 2.0 with a perceived “true” price of 1.8.\n\nNow, 100 bets is a lot! Especially if it’s a system that only throws up a handful of bets a week. This could be several months’ work - and yet clearly there is a lot of crossover between the two curves. You could quite feasibly be losing with a very good system, OR you could be showing a decent profit from pure guesses.\nAfter running the tool with the parameters mentioned above, the accompanying results table reveals that the probability of being in profit, if your prices are correct, is 86.82%. So that’s just over a 13% probability of being down after 100 bets despite having a pretty solid edge.\nIf we increase the number of bets to 1000, the two curves are now a lot more distinct, and the probability of an overall loss if your 1.8 price is correct is virtually nil:\n\n 1000 bets at 2.0 with a perceived “true” price of 1.8."

    "text": "Central limit theorem\nSo this is all great in theory, but what about in practice? Not all bets are placed at even money; would the distribution for other prices really follow a nice smooth bell curve?\nThe answer is: basically, yes! Thanks to the central limit theorem, the mean of a sample will approximate a normal distribution as long as the sample is sufficiently large. And what is sufficiently large? The rule of thumb for statisticians is around 30, based on empirical observation. Let’s see how that looks.\nI created a small function in R that calculates the profit or loss after 30 bets at 2.0 (i.e. even money). Then, I wrote a second function that simulated the 30 bets 10,000 times and plotted a histogram of the outcomes.\n\n\n\nAs promised, after only 30 bets we can see that the distribution of the mean outcome resembles a beautiful bell shape.\nBut that’s for the easy scenario where we are betting at even money. What about a more skewed distribution? I changed the odds to 5.0, perhaps betting on away underdogs in football matches. Here is how the distribution looks after 30 bets:\n\n\n\nSo you can see that even with odds of 5.0, after 30 bets the overall distribution is fairly close to normal - certainly close enough to be robust to statistical tests.\nIf we move to more extreme lopsided distributions, that’s when the sample size of 30 becomes too small. Here I demonstrate 30 bets at odds of 20.0, maybe betting on horses, or golfers to win a tournament:\n\n\n\nThe distribution is now skewed to the right. Clearly your maximum loss is capped at 30 units, but profits of greater than 30 are quite feasible if 3 or 4 winners come in. So it would not be appropriate to use a normal distribution to represent these 30 bets. But if we increase the number of bets to 100 at the same odds, then we start to see the normal distribution shape emerge.\n\n\n\nSo generally speaking, it should be fine to use a normal distribution to represent the range of outcomes one might reasonably expect from a series of independent bets, as long as you have a sample of around 30 bets or more."

    "section": "A real life example from my betting",
    "text": "A real life example from my betting\nSo far, I have just been giving hypothetical examples where the odds are the same for every bet. You could actually use the binomial distribution if that were the case, but in reality you are going to have lots of different prices and stake sizes in your ledger.\nBecause each bet is an independent Bernoulli event (it wins or it loses), it is simple to calculate the expected variance for each bet. And a great property of variance is that the variance of a sum of variables is simply the sum of the variance of each variable! So that makes it simple to create a normal distribution curve from any set of bets.\nHere’s a real life example from a football system I was testing for small stakes. This is something I strongly advise any time you think you have found something: test it with real money! Back-testing or paper trading is one thing, but there is no substitute for actually getting real money down. Just be sensible, of course - there’s no need to lose an uncomfortable amount while testing out a new method.\nBelow are the results after 405 bets. I had staked over £29,000 in total, which may sound like a lot but it is less than £100 per bet. At that bet size, a profit of £2,824 from a large number of bets would certainly get you excited! The return on investment (ROI) is 9.58%, though personally I’ve always found ROI to be misleading and limited when it comes to measuring betting performance.\n\n\n\n\nTotal number of bets\n\n\n405\n\n\n\n\nTotal staked\n\n\n£29,495.07\n\n\n\n\nTotal profit\n\n\n£2,824.24\n\n\n\n\nROI\n\n\n9.58%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuffice to say, I was feeling pretty excited about this system. I really thought I had found something! And you can see from the dashed line, these results are closer to the centre of the “my price” curve than the market price curve.\nHowever, there is still enough overlap with the right tail of the market price curve to suggest that this run of results could all just be good luck. In fact the probability is around 8% that one will be at least this far in profit when one has no edge. And…that’s exactly what came to pass. Here are my results after 830 bets:\n\n\n\n\nTotal number of bets\n\n\n830\n\n\n\n\nTotal staked\n\n\n£61,279.54\n\n\n\n\nTotal profit\n\n\n-£413.36\n\n\n\n\nROI\n\n\n-0.67%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLo and behold, I ended up almost smack on the expected return assuming the market price is correct. (Note that this is slightly below zero as it was on an exchange, so commission is factored in).\nI actually still quite like the system in question, but it needs some development. And that’s another great thing about deploying your bets to small stakes: even if it doesn’t make money, you tend to learn something. Humans are great learners, and just being active in the market will give you a feel for all sorts of nuances that are hard to gauge otherwise."

Even after 100 or more bets, variance plays a large role in your overall profit & loss, so don’t get too excited about any successes, and don’t give up on a losing system too quickly.\nFinally, there is one way to combat variance by using variance reduction methods. For example, if betting on football, one might use expected goals (xG) to derive the post-match expected win % for each team instead of the binary 1/0 result. Because expected wins have less variance than actual wins, the curves will be narrower and will diverge more quickly.\nI would urge a fair amount of caution though - ultimately it’s results we are betting on, and if there is some element of winning a football match that is not captured by xG…well, that could be an edge in itself!\n\nI welcome feedback!

    "section": "",
    "text": "I demonstrate how the Poisson and negative binomial distributions compare to actual football scores from the English top flight, and how we can convert Elo ratings into correct score probabilities.\n\n\nBackground\nI hope you enjoyed my recent article looking at the worst league title collapses in English football history. If not, you can read it here.\nNow I will go into a little more depth on the model I used to simulate scores using daily Elo ratings from Club Elo. You can find all my code and data files for this project in my GitHub repo.\nSince the Elo ratings only begin in 1940, we will have to ignore results prior to World War Two. Our first task, as always, is to do some data inspection.\n\n\nHow Football Has Changed Since 1946\nFirst, let’s look at the changes in goalscoring rate through the years. Now, I decided not to account for varying goal rates in this model, because it adds a fair amount of complexity and I didn’t think it would be necessary given the task at hand. Nonetheless, it is still interesting to see how the game has changed over the last 80 years, especially the huge decrease in the latter half of the 1960s:\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at how home supremacy has changed in the English top flight. This has shown a steady downward trend, presumably due to improved travel and accommodation for away sides. Not many teams took their own chef on the road in the 1950s.\nAnd to help answer the question “how much of home advantage is due to the fans?” we can look at the 2021 COVID season, played in empty stadia, where home supremacy dropped to almost zero.\n\n\n\nFinally, we can summarise the mean Elo rating of English top flight teams over the same time period. The overall trend is upward, and it is also notable that the standard deviation (shown by the light blue band) gets wider as time goes on. The spread of team quality in the modern Premier League, as I’m sure you are aware, is much wider than it used to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Do Elo Ratings Work?\nNow we can look at the Elo rating system itself. It was originally designed by Arpad Elo to rank chess players, but can be extended to any zero-sum game with two players or teams.\nWhen two teams play against one another, they are effectively gambling a portion of their points, with the better team (according to their Elo ratings) putting more of their points at stake than the inferior team.\nSince the winner gains the same number of points as the loser loses (the definition of ‘zero-sum’), the population of ratings sits around a consistent long-term average - typically 1500, but any arbitrary number can be chosen.\nYou can find a full explanation of how Club Elo calculates its ratings here. There are adjustments for margin of victory, home advantage, and what they call “tilt” (whether a team’s games are higher or lower scoring than average).\nWe can use Club Elo’s formula to calculate the predicted probability for each game in the data, with 0.5 awarded for a draw. Below I have plotted the deciles of teams’ predicted probability to see how they match up with actual results.\n\n\n\nThe plotted points should approximately follow the dashed line but as you can see, Elo seems to overestimate favourites’ chances and underestimate underdogs’ chances.\nTo reiterate, this is when allotting 0.5 points for a draw. I don’t know how it would fare when trying to predict actual win-draw-lose results instead, or if it’s possible to derive that simply from the Elo difference.\nBut that is our next task!\n\n\nGenerating Realistic Football Scores\nClearly if we are going to simulate league tables, we need actual scores rather than just results. And we certainly need some draws and not “half wins”. So how can we simulate realistic football scores?\nNow let me make it clear at this point, I am not breaking any new ground here. There is a large body of work dedicated to the distribution of football scores going back as far as the 1950s. For further reading I recommend Reep, Maher, Dixon-Coles, and others.\nBut I find it useful and educational to try and build these things yourself step by step, so here we go. I promise to try and keep the maths (math for American readers) as light as possible.\n\n\nUseful Probability Distributions\nIn statistics, when we have an event that will happen some random number of times during a time interval, it is common to use the Poisson distribution. Given that we know the average number of goals scored by teams in our dataset (1.42), we can simply plug that into R’s dpois function and it will give us the probability of 0 goals, 1 goal, 2 goals, and so forth.\nThen we can compare these probabilities with the actual observed relative frequency of each score:\n\n\n\nSo what’s going on? Poisson is overpredicting scores of 1, 2 and 3, but underpredicting 0, 4, 5, and all higher scores up to infinity. This is a problem known as overdispersion.\nThe Poisson distribution relies on an assumption that the mean is equal to the variance. In reality, this assumption is often not satisfied.\nIndeed, the variance of our football scores is 1.65 compared to the mean of 1.42. That’s why the actual scores are more spread out (more 0s, more 5s and 6s) compared to the Poisson predictions (more 1s and 2s).\nThis is where the negative binomial distribution comes to our rescue! The negative binomial distribution in its most common form would be used to model things like “if I have a 70% chance of making each free throw, what is the probability that I miss exactly 5 free throws before I make my 10th successful free throw?” Anyone who took a probability class at university will be familiar with fun questions like that.\nBut the negative binomial distribution can also be expressed in a different way to make it very similar to the Poisson distribution, with a mean but also an additional parameter θ which is known (amongst other things) as the dispersion parameter. This allows us to build a Poisson-like distribution but to toggle the shape by changing θ. The two distributions are related - in fact, if you keep increasing θ, the negative binomial gets closer and closer to Poisson.\nBelow I have added the negative binomial distribution (with θ = 10) alongside the Poisson and the actual observed results:\n\n\n\nNot bad! We instantly see that this is a huge improvement over Poisson, and honestly does a pretty good job of fitting the actual observed scores. To demonstrate how increasing θ affects the negative binomial distribution, here is the same plot with θ = 10,000. It is now indistinguishable from the Poisson distribution:\n\n\n\nSo we’re done, right? Just use a negative binomial distribution with θ = 10 to model football scores. Not so simple, I’m afraid! That would be making an assumption that you can generate a score for team A, and then generate a score for team B, as if the two things happen independently. But is that a fair assumption?\n\n\nAre Team Scores Independent?\nTo test that assumption we need to look at the conditional distribution of a team once we know how many goals their opponents have scored:\n\n\n\nSo now we can see there is a problem. When the opponent has scored 0, the distribution underestimates 0. When the opponent has scored 1, the distribution underestimates 1. When the opponent has scored 2, the distribution underestimates 2, and so on.\nWhat this means is, in actual football, there are more draws than would be expected by generating two independent scores. This is not hard to explain: when a game is level, teams will take relatively fewer risks. When a team is trailing by one goal, they will throw men forward and make the game more open in pursuit of an equaliser. So the overall effect is that final scores are slightly more likely to be draws.\n\n\nAccounting for Team Strength\nWe also have another problem that we haven’t addressed yet. We are generating scores for an aggregate of all teams in our dataset. But teams’ abilities can vary significantly! So we need an algorithm that gives us the mean and distribution for one team, based on the difference in the teams’ Elo ratings, and then the mean and distribution for the second team, based not only on the Elo ratings but also on the score of the first team!\nThe simplest way to approach this is by first generating the score of the favourite (i.e. the team with the higher Elo rating after home advantage has been applied). I fit this with a simple quadratic model of the difference in Elo ratings. Below we can see how this compares with the negative binomial with θ = 35. Remember, this is now an aggregation of different predictions across all of the games in the dataset.\n\n\n\nIt’s a good fit. So the favourites at least seem to be sorted, and we can see that the negative binomial with θ = 35 is superior to Poisson.\nBut what about the underdog? It’s slightly more complex to fit the underdog’s mean goals scored because now we have to account for the number of goals scored by the favourite.\nIn addition, I added interaction terms to the quadratic model. What are interactions? A simple way to explain this is, if Real Madrid were playing against Tranmere Rovers and I told you Real Madrid scored 3 goals, would it change your prediction of how many Tranmere scored? Probably not. If I told you Tranmere scored 3? Clearly your estimates for Real Madrid scoring 3+ should increase. That is an interaction between two variables, because the first variable (number of goals scored by the opposition) has a different effect on the outcome depending on a second variable (quality of the opposition).\nSo let’s see how the underdog scores come out, conditional on the goals scored by the favourite:\n\n\n\nClearly there is a problem. I tried a few different values of θ - the above plots are with θ = 5 because that’s a good fit when the favourite scores 0. But it’s a poor fit for the other scores. So what we probably need is a different θ depending on the favourite’s score!\nI trained a function to find the optimal θ for each value of the favourite’s score, and these were the results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFav_Goals\nDispersion\n\n\n\n\n0\n8\n\n\n1\n35\n\n\n2\n61\n\n\n3\n10000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see how the conditional plots look with these fitted dispersions:\n\n\n\nAs Roy Walker would say: “It’s good, but it’s not the one.” So now it’s time to use some brute force. We know that the underdog’s score is more likely to match the favourite’s score, so let’s do exactly that.\n\n\nInflating Draw Probabilities\nI repeated the last optimization, but this time with an extra parameter that inflates the probability of the underdog getting the same score as the favourite. All values were adjusted proportionally to ensure the total probability was still 1, of course. Here are the results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpp_Goals\nDispersion\nInflation\n\n\n\n\n0\n569\n0.093\n\n\n1\n14\n0.050\n\n\n2\n321\n0.009\n\n\n3\n198\n0.006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo when the favourite scores 0, there is a big boost to the probability of the underdog scoring 0. When the favourite scores 1, the effect reduces by almost half. For 2 or more goals, the inflation is minimal.\nNow how does that look in the conditional distribution?\n\n\n\nI’m pretty happy with that overall. The scores seem to track reality quite well, so we can now generate a probability of every scoreline (0-0, 2-1, 3-3, etc) for each game in the dataset and derive probabilities of win-draw-loss for each team. Let’s calibrate our model by comparing these probabilities with the actual results and scores:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deciles track pretty nicely as the dashed line falls inside all the error bars except one. Note that the probabilities are different to the earlier decile plot because that one was using “half wins” when a game was drawn, whereas this plot assumes a draw is not a win (i.e. it is 0, the same as a loss).\nThe W-D-L plot and correct scores plot are close; there just seems to be a stubborn difference in the 1-1 predictions for some reason. But for the task at hand, this should easily be adequate.\n\n\nSummary\nVia this process we have ended up with something similar to the Dixon-Coles model, which uses a Poisson distribution with inflated probabilities of low scores (0-0, 0-1, 1-1, 1-0).\nBy fitting scores conditionally and inflating the probability of draws, we have a system that can generate realistic match outcomes from Elo ratings alone. This forms a solid foundation for simulating league tables and other competitions, although for advanced analysis I would always advise users to be conscious of the GIGO problem.\nThanks for reading, and as I mentioned earlier, you can find all the code relating to this project at my GitHub repo.\n\nData Sources\nI gather match data from a variety of public sources.

    "section": "Man City’s decline",
    "text": "Man City’s decline\nAs for the ratings: firstly we can look at the start of the season, and remind ourselves that Manchester City were still considered a class above the rest when the season kicked off, rated +1.61, more than half a goal ahead of Arsenal and Liverpool.\nCity had won the last 4 titles, and 6 of the last 7. It’s pretty easy to connect their decline last season to Rodri’s ACL injury, and we can see that City’s rating steadily got worse throughout the season, dipping as low as +0.62 before rallying at the end.\nNow, I would introduce a note of caution with regards to ratings near the end of the season. Ratings are based on the odds for each individual match, and in the final few weeks there can be vast disparities in motivation between teams. While City had some must-win matches for Champions League qualification, many other teams in the league had no such incentive since the title and relegation places were all decided relatively early. And certain teams, most notably Tottenham, had evidently prioritised cup competitions.\nSpeaking of Spurs, we can see that in November they were still rated +0.51 and considered a team worthy of a Champions League finish. Indeed, they had some good results around this time, putting 4 goals past West Ham, Aston Villa and Man City, but were struggling with consistency. A horrendous injury crisis then led to a loss of form and confidence, and a subsequent shift of focus to the Europa League, which they won, but their rating had declined by more than a full goal by the season’s end.\nIt was a somewhat similar tale for Manchester United, whose rating opened at +0.46 and closed at -0.46. Despite the loss of revenue as a result of the defeat to Spurs in the Europa League final, United have conjured another huge amount of money to buy new forwards over the summer, and it will be fascinating to see whether these two teams perform like “big 6” clubs, or more like they were rated in May: 16th and 17th in the Premier League.\nThe other notable decline was from Southampton. Obviously it was an appalling season for the Saints - one of the all-time worst PL seasons in fact, as they secured only 12 points. But it’s easy to forget that they actually came up looking like the most likely to survive of the three promoted teams. At the start of the season, Southampton were rated at -0.69 compared to Ipswich at -1.10 and Leicester -1.12.\nThings quickly went downhill, and Southampton’s struggles emphasise the difficulty of sustaining a front-foot, possession-based strategy when transitioning from the Championship into a league where you are going to be playing against vastly superior talent."

    "text": "On the rise: Newcastle, Aston Villa, Bournemouth et al.\nOn the flip side, there were numerous teams that improved as the season wore on, relative to their ratings in August. Newcastle and Aston Villa were both considered outsiders for a Champions League place, and the Geordies clearly benefitted from an absence of European football that had proved such a burden the previous season.\nVilla, meanwhile, were distracted by their own run to the Champions League quarter-finals, and it is notable that their form picked up in the second half of the season after the slog of the newly expanded league phase was over. In fact, Villa ended the season with a rating of +0.68 which put them marginally ahead of Arsenal in third place. That rating is partly helped by a fortuitous fixture list which gave them both Europa League finalists Spurs and Manchester United in their final two games, and they will be desperately disappointed to have been well-beaten by the latter in their crucial last game.\nOne of the great success stories in recent seasons has been Bournemouth, whose stock rose steadily throughout the season. The Cherries were rated as genuine European contenders (+0.42) at the season’s end, and it will be interesting to see how they can withstand the loss of key defenders Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi and Milos Kerkez, all of whom have been picked off by European giants.\nInterestingly, despite spending much of the season in the top four, Nottingham Forest were never rated higher than mid-table, peaking at +0.05 in February. This is a good example of the cold-headed realism markets offer, while fans and TV pundits can be prone to hyperbole when they don’t have money on the line.\nOne pattern that emerges is a more compressed league by the end of the season. Arguably that is partly down to Liverpool and Arsenal easing off after the title had been decided. But it is also because the smaller teams that might traditionally struggle, like Bournemouth, Fulham and Brentford, all surpassed expectations."

I’m sure some will mention Spurs or United for banter purposes, but realistically if any of the new boys are going to survive, it will be because one of the smaller clubs has an unexpectedly bad year, perhaps because of injuries they don’t have the depth to withstand."
