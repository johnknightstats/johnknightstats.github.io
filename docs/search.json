    "text": "5. Burnley 1961-1962 (Probability: 80.4%)\nIf you had asked me to name every club to have been champions of England, I’ll be honest, Ipswich Town might be one of the trickier ones. But when I scratched beneath the surface, their 1961-1962 win emerges as one of the more fascinating and unexpected championships in football league history.\n\n Ipswich Town 1961-1962. They may look like Al Capone’s henchmen, but these guys were champions of England.\n\nAt the time, Burnley were a true force in English football, having won the league in 1960 and in the midst of a run of 12 consecutive top half finishes. The dominant team of the era were Bill Nicholson’s Spurs, coming off a historic league & cup double the previous season, and this year reaching the European Cup semi-final where they would lose to Benfica.\nThere was also an emerging Everton side who were about to embark on a 10-year stretch where they won two league titles and finished outside the top 6 only once.\nIpswich, meanwhile, were playing in the top flight for the first time in the club’s history under manager Alf Ramsey, a former Spurs right back who learned his trade under Arthur Rowe in Tottenham’s influential “push and run” champions of 1951.\nDespite trailing by a point, on the 14th of April Burnley had two games in hand and as the strongest team were still considered 80% favourites, with the next two games at home to Lancashire rivals Blackburn and Blackpool.\n\n Division One Table on 14 April 1962 (42-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGA\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nIpswich Town\n\n\n38\n\n\n84\n\n\n63\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n50\n\n\n1679\n\n\n19.4\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBurnley\n\n\n36\n\n\n97\n\n\n58\n\n\n1.67\n\n\n49\n\n\n1753\n\n\n80.3\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n37\n\n\n72\n\n\n47\n\n\n1.53\n\n\n43\n\n\n1691\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n36\n\n\n75\n\n\n61\n\n\n1.23\n\n\n43\n\n\n1733\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nSheffield United\n\n\n38\n\n\n56\n\n\n64\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n43\n\n\n1628\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAston Villa\n\n\n37\n\n\n50\n\n\n46\n\n\n1.09\n\n\n39\n\n\n1649\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 6 games to go, Burnley were the best team, with the best goal average, and two games in hand.\n\nOne thing this model doesn’t account for is fixture congestion. Burnley had played an FA Cup semi-final replay on the 9th of April, and faced a staggering 8 further league games in the remainder of the month, including three games in four days.\n\nBurnley’s Closing Results 1961-1962\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17 April 1962\n\n\nBlackburn Rovers (H)\n\n\nL\n\n\n0 - 1\n\n\n\n\n20 April 1962\n\n\nBlackpool (H)\n\n\nW\n\n\n2 - 0\n\n\n\n\n21 April 1962\n\n\nSheffield United (A)\n\n\nL\n\n\n0 - 2\n\n\n\n\n23 April 1962\n\n\nBlackpool (A)\n\n\nD\n\n\n1 - 1\n\n\n\n\n28 April 1962\n\n\nChelsea (H)\n\n\nD\n\n\n1 - 1\n\n\n\n\n30 April 1962\n\n\nSheffield Wednesday (A)\n\n\nL\n\n\n0 - 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurgen Klopp would not be amused if you gave him this fixture list.\n\nBurnley’s finish was grim: just one win from their final eight games. Ipswich became 61% favourites after a 3-0 win at Arsenal in their penultimate match, before sealing the championship with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa with star striker Ray Crawford scoring both goals.\n\nDivision One Title Race 1961-1962  Ipswich lost only one of their final 16 league matches.\n\nBurnley still had a game remaining after the title race was over, which they duly lost 4-0 to Sheffield Wednesday, and then to rub salt into the wounds they were beaten by Spurs in the FA Cup Final.\n\nFinal Division One Table 1961-1962\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGA\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nIpswich Town\n\n\n42\n\n\n93\n\n\n67\n\n\n1.39\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBurnley\n\n\n42\n\n\n101\n\n\n67\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n42\n\n\n88\n\n\n69\n\n\n1.28\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n42\n\n\n88\n\n\n54\n\n\n1.63\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nSheffield United\n\n\n42\n\n\n61\n\n\n69\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\n\n42\n\n\n72\n\n\n58\n\n\n1.24\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIpswich won the league in their first ever top flight season.\n\nFor Ipswich, it really seems like they caught lightning in a bottle for that one season. They were thrashed 5-1 by Spurs in the following year’s Charity Shield and lost to AC Milan in the first round of the European Cup.\nBy October 1962, Ramsey had already agreed to take over the England job the following summer, leading them to a World Cup triumph in 1966. Ipswich would end the season in 17th place and then were relegated rock bottom a year later.\nBut this was far from the end of the good times in Suffolk – a decade later, another future England manager named Bobby Robson would oversee a more sustained period of success including an FA Cup, UEFA Cup and league finishes of 4th, 4th, 3rd, 3rd, 3rd, 2nd, 2nd…but not 1st."

    "text": "4. Manchester United 1991-1992 (Probability: 80.9%)\nThe 1991-1992 season is often seen as the final year of the old era due to the impending rebrand of Football League Division One to the Premier League. But it was also the final year of Manchester United’s long league title drought since the days of Charlton, Best, and Law in 1967.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, of course, United’s late collapse in 1992 is a mere footnote beneath the outrageous success of the Alex Ferguson era. But what a collapse it was!\nAs the previous year’s champions Arsenal had mounted a disappointing defence of their title and perennial powerhouses Liverpool declined under the disastrous reign of Graeme Souness, the Red Devils found themselves in a commanding position on the 16th of April, two points clear of Leeds United with a game in hand.\nLeeds had only been promoted two years beforehand but had finished a creditable 4th in the previous campaign, and boasted one of those great midfields that is still easy to rattle off today: Speed, McAllister, Batty, Strachan. They also signed a chap called Eric Cantona from Marseille in January, after he was turned down by Souness at Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday couldn’t afford his wages.\n\n Division One Table on 16 April 1992 (42-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester United\n\n\n37\n\n\n58\n\n\n26\n\n\n+32\n\n\n74\n\n\n1800\n\n\n80.9\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nLeeds United\n\n\n38\n\n\n68\n\n\n35\n\n\n+33\n\n\n72\n\n\n1780\n\n\n18.9\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nSheffield Wednesday\n\n\n38\n\n\n58\n\n\n48\n\n\n+10\n\n\n67\n\n\n1715\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n70\n\n\n43\n\n\n+27\n\n\n64\n\n\n1829\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n37\n\n\n44\n\n\n35\n\n\n+9\n\n\n58\n\n\n1764\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n50\n\n\n45\n\n\n+5\n\n\n58\n\n\n1736\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited were expected to win their first league championship since 1967.\n\nThe impact of Cantona at Leeds that season is perhaps overstated (he only made 6 starts, scoring twice) but it remains a remarkable fact that Cantona won the title in every season he played in England other than 1994-1995, when he was suspended from January onwards after attacking a supporter at Selhurst Park.\nWith five games to go, the model gave Manchester United an 81% chance of finally ending their barren run, and even after a 1-1 draw at Luton things were still looking good.\nAnd then the wheels truly came off.\n\nDivision One Title Race 1991-1992  With three successive defeats, United’s chances went from 80% to 0% in the space of one week.\n\nIn a grueling run of fixtures, Fergie’s men contested the League Cup Final on 12 April, defeating Nottingham Forest 1-0, and then played league matches on the 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, and 26th.\nIt was Forest who inflicted the first major defeat, getting revenge for Wembley with a 2-1 win at Old Trafford that sent the title race into coin flip territory. And then, shockingly, United lost 1-0 to a West Ham team that had lost 10 of its last 13 games and would be relegated in bottom place.

Still recovering from the disastrous Hicks-Gillett ownership era, the Reds had only finished 7th, 6th, 8th, and 7th in the previous four campaigns.\nBut Liverpool had a few things that clicked together this year. Thanks to a lack of European football and early domestic cup exits away to Arsenal and Man Utd, Brendan Rodgers’ side only played 43 matches all season compared to 57 each for Man City and Chelsea.\nAnd up front, the emergence of teenager Raheem Sterling alongside Daniel Sturridge and the genuinely world class performances of Luis Suarez electrified a forward line that had until recently included £35m flop Andy Carroll.\n\n Premier League Table on 20 April 2014 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n35\n\n\n96\n\n\n44\n\n\n+52\n\n\n80\n\n\n1916\n\n\n82.2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n35\n\n\n67\n\n\n26\n\n\n+41\n\n\n75\n\n\n1944\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n33\n\n\n88\n\n\n34\n\n\n+54\n\n\n71\n\n\n1949\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n35\n\n\n62\n\n\n41\n\n\n+21\n\n\n70\n\n\n1850\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n35\n\n\n57\n\n\n34\n\n\n+23\n\n\n69\n\n\n1836\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n35\n\n\n51\n\n\n49\n\n\n+2\n\n\n63\n\n\n1803\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool closed in on 100 goals and the title.\n\nFollowing the epic 3-2 win over Man City and an away victory at Norwich by the same score, Liverpool found themselves five points clear of Chelsea and nine clear of City. The model gave them an 82% probability of lifting a first league title since 1990.\nIt would require seven points from the final three games to guarantee the championship, and Liverpool’s prospects were further improved by the fact that Chelsea, with only slim odds of the title themselves and preparing for a crucial Champions League semi-final second leg against Atletico Madrid, decided to rest several key players for the Anfield clash on 27 April (ironically, one of the backups who played as a result was a certain Mohamed Salah).\n\nPremier League Title Race 2013-2014  Liverpool’s defeat to Chelsea was a huge blow, but City’s win at Everton was equally pivotal.\n\nAlas, a Mourinho defensive masterclass ensued, and the surprising 0-2 defeat to Chelsea, including the now infamous slip by Steven Gerrard to gift Demba Ba the opener, sent Liverpool’s odds crashing from 80% to 48%.\n\n One of the iconic Premier League moments.\n\nEqually shocking was the 3-3 draw away to Crystal Palace from a commanding 3-0 lead late on, but perhaps one of the more overlooked results of this stretch was City’s 3-2 victory away to a strong Everton side who finished on 72 points under Roberto Martinez - still their highest total since winning the league themselves in 1987.\nThis win improved City’s title probability by more than 30% - almost the same impact as Liverpool’s loss to Chelsea, but the latter is remembered as being far more decisive.\n\nFinal Premier League Table 2013-2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n102\n\n\n37\n\n\n+65\n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n38\n\n\n101\n\n\n50\n\n\n+51\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n38\n\n\n71\n\n\n27\n\n\n+44\n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n68\n\n\n41\n\n\n+27\n\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n38\n\n\n61\n\n\n39\n\n\n+22\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n55\n\n\n51\n\n\n+4\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, a defence that conceded 50 goals wasn’t quite good enough.\n\nCity closed out the title with routine home wins against Aston Villa and West Ham, and a 4th league championship for the club was secured (they now have ten!).\nMeanwhile, Liverpool would have to continue the wait for #19, and Steven Gerrard ended his otherwise fantastic career with none.

    "text": "2. Liverpool 1988-1989 (Probability: 93.1%)\nThe 1988-1989 season is defined by two seismic events, quite different in nature. The Hillsborough disaster is obviously one, and the other is the climactic final game that is unlikely to ever be surpassed.\nOf course, the events at Hillsborough had an enormous effect on Liverpool’s end to this season – not just emotionally, but the task of playing 8 games in May to make up for postponements.\n\n Division One Table on 6 May 1989 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n35\n\n\n68\n\n\n32\n\n\n+36\n\n\n72\n\n\n1840\n\n\n74.8\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n33\n\n\n55\n\n\n24\n\n\n+31\n\n\n64\n\n\n1904\n\n\n25.2\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nNorwich City\n\n\n36\n\n\n46\n\n\n42\n\n\n+4\n\n\n61\n\n\n1715\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nNottingham Forest\n\n\n34\n\n\n57\n\n\n38\n\n\n+19\n\n\n60\n\n\n1819\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n37\n\n\n60\n\n\n45\n\n\n+15\n\n\n57\n\n\n1752\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nDerby County\n\n\n35\n\n\n38\n\n\n33\n\n\n+5\n\n\n55\n\n\n1697\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal were in command of the table as Liverpool dealt with the aftermath of Hillsborough.\n\nIt was actually Arsenal, built around young academy products Tony Adams, Paul Merson, David Rocastle and Michael Thomas, who initially looked like they had blown their chance. Eight points clear on the 6th of May, the model rated them as 75% favourites before a surprise 2-1 defeat at home to Derby thanks to two goals from future Liverpool striker Dean Saunders.\n\nDivision One Title Race 1988-1989  Liverpool clawed their way back…until the very final hurdle.\n\nWith Liverpool winning 2-1 at Wimbledon on the same day, the odds had flip-flopped, and when the Reds thrashed West Ham 5-1 they entered the final game with a superior GD by four goals. To win the title, Arsenal would need to win by two clear goals in the decider at fortress Anfield, rated by the model as just a 7% probability.\n\n Division One Table on 23 May 1989 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n37\n\n\n65\n\n\n26\n\n\n+39\n\n\n76\n\n\n1916\n\n\n93.1\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n37\n\n\n71\n\n\n36\n\n\n+35\n\n\n73\n\n\n1830\n\n\n6.9\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nNottingham Forest\n\n\n38\n\n\n64\n\n\n43\n\n\n+21\n\n\n64\n\n\n1824\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nNorwich City\n\n\n38\n\n\n48\n\n\n45\n\n\n+3\n\n\n62\n\n\n1715\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nDerby County\n\n\n38\n\n\n40\n\n\n38\n\n\n+2\n\n\n58\n\n\n1704\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n60\n\n\n46\n\n\n+14\n\n\n57\n\n\n1769\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool simply had to avoid defeat by two or more goals at Anfield in the final game.\n\nAnd the rest is history.

If there’s one thing we can learn about teams who blow titles, it’s that the most successful clubs are going to be the ones who give themselves lots of opportunities to mess it up.\nWe’ve covered United’s 1992 collapse, and it feels appropriate to end with 2012 as those two years nicely bookend the dominant Ferguson era.\nI remember watching City fans doing the Poznan during their 6-1 win at Old Trafford and thinking “good for them” - some payback for a lifetime of sitting through garbage while their local rivals win everything. These feelings quickly wore off of course when Abu Dhabi’s billions started hoovering up trophies on an annual basis. But it did feel fresh for a short time.\nThe dramatic nature of Sergio Aguero’s injury time winner in the final game has perhaps allowed many of us to forget just what a commanding position United had allowed to slip away. Eight points clear with six games to go, United had a 95% probability of retaining the Premier League trophy according to the model.\n\n Premier League Table on 9 April 2012 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester United\n\n\n32\n\n\n78\n\n\n27\n\n\n+51\n\n\n79\n\n\n1920\n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n32\n\n\n75\n\n\n26\n\n\n+49\n\n\n71\n\n\n1887\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n32\n\n\n63\n\n\n41\n\n\n+22\n\n\n61\n\n\n1826\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n33\n\n\n57\n\n\n38\n\n\n+19\n\n\n59\n\n\n1796\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nNewcastle United\n\n\n33\n\n\n50\n\n\n42\n\n\n+8\n\n\n59\n\n\n1746\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n33\n\n\n56\n\n\n38\n\n\n+18\n\n\n57\n\n\n1852\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, City manager Roberto Mancini declared that the title race was over.\n\nEven a shock 1-0 defeat at Wigan didn’t seem too terminal, but it was United’s 4-4 draw at home to Everton, having led 4-2 with 10 minutes remaining, that suddenly put City within striking distance as the foes squared off the following week.\nA Vincent Kompany header gave City a 1-0 win, and in the blink of an eye they were 60% favourites.\n\nPremier League Title Race 2011-2012  United opened the door, but City still needed to win all 6 games…which they did.\n\nCity still faced a tricky visit to Newcastle, who ended up 5th under Alan Pardew for their best finish in a decade. A Yaya Toure brace secured the points, and it now seemed like almost a formality that City would beat relegation-threatened QPR in the final game to seal the league.\nBut football can be unpredictable, and QPR found themselves 2-1 up going into injury time, after Joey Barton was sent off and had a meltdown that would result in a 12 match ban.\nUnited did their part, winning at Sunderland, and you all know what happened next of course, with Dzeko equalizing and then Aguero driving home the winner to provoke wild scenes at the Etihad Stadium.\nRemarkably, this means that United’s title-winning probability dropped from 95% to 12%, then back up in the 90s with City trailing, and finally back to zero.

Eventually the relationship was repaired sufficiently for Tevez to return and start the final six games of the season, City winning all six.\n\nFinal Premier League Table 2011-2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n93\n\n\n29\n\n\n+64\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nManchester United\n\n\n38\n\n\n89\n\n\n33\n\n\n+56\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n74\n\n\n49\n\n\n+25\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n66\n\n\n41\n\n\n+25\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nNewcastle United\n\n\n38\n\n\n56\n\n\n51\n\n\n+5\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n38\n\n\n65\n\n\n46\n\n\n+19\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan City’s name at the top was an unusual sight in those days.\n\nAnd so City won the title on goal difference, the only time that has happened in the Premier League era.

    "title": "Building an Elo Simulation Model for Retrospective League Winner Daily Probabilities",
    "section": "",
    "text": "John Knight\n\n11 July 2025\n\n\n\nHere I show how the model was built\n\nI hope you enjoyed my recent article looking at the worst league title collapses in English football history. If not, you can read it here.\nNow I will go into a little more depth on the model I used to simulate scores from Elo ratings. There’s a bit of mathematics involved, but nothing too heavy.\nAs mentioned in the original article, daily Elo Ratings were taken from Club Elo. FBRef has all results for the entire history of the English top flight, which is pretty cool. I had to create some mappings to link the FBRef team names to the Club Elo ones. You can find all my code and data files for this project in my GitHub repo.\nSince the Elo ratings only begin in 1940, we will have to ignore results prior to World War 2. Our first task, as always, is to do some data inspection.\nI took the decision not to account for varying goal rates in this model, because it adds a fair amount of complexity and I didn’t think it would add a huge amount given the task at hand. Nonetheless, it is still interesting to see how the number of goals per game has changed over the last 80 years, especially the huge decrease in the latter half of the 1960s.\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at home supremacy in the English top flight through the years. This has shown a steady decrease, presumably due to improved travel and accommodation for away sides. Not many teams traveled with their own chef in the 1950s.\nAnd of course, the 2021 value close to zero helped to answer the question “how much of home advantage is due to the fans?” Answer: a lot.\n\n\n\nFinally, we can summarise the mean Elo rating of English top flight teams over the same time period. The overall trend is upward, and it is also notable that the standard deviation (shown by the light blue band) gets wider as time goes on. The spread of team quality, as I’m sure you are aware, is much wider than it used to be.\n\n\n\nNow we can look at the Elo rating system itself. It was originally designed by Arpad Elo to rank chess players, but can be extended to any zero-sum game with two players or teams. When two teams play against one another, they are effectively gambling a portion of their points, with the better team (according to their Elo ratings) putting more of their points at stake than the inferior team. Since the winner gains the same number of points as the loser loses (i.e. ‘zero-sum’), the population of ratings sits around a consistent long-term average - typically 1500, but any arbitrary number can be chosen.\nYou can find a full explanation of how Club Elo calculates its ratings here. There are adjustments for margin of victory, home advantage, and what they call “tilt” (whether a team’s games are higher or lower scoring than average).\nWe can use Club Elo’s formula to calculate the forecast probability for each game in the data, with 0.5 awarded for a draw. Below I have plotted the deciles of teams’ predicted probability to see how they match up with actual results.\n\n\n\nThe plotted points should approximately follow the dashed line but as you can see, Elo seems to overestimate favourites’ chances and underestimate underdogs’ chances. To reiterate, this is when allotting 0.5 points for a draw. I don’t know how it would fare when trying to predict actual win-draw-lose results instead, or if it’s possible to derive that simply from the Elo difference.\nBut that is our next task!\nClearly if we are going to simulate league tables, we need actual scores rather than just results. And we certainly need some draws and not “half wins”. So how can we simulate realistic football scores?\nNow let me make it clear at this point, I am not breaking any new ground here. There is a large body of work dedicated to the distribution of football scores going back as far as the 1950s. For further reading I recommend Reep, Maher, Dixon-Coles. But I find it useful and educational to try and build these things yourself step by step, so here we go. I promise to try and keep the maths (math for American readers) as light as possible.\nIn statistics, when we have an event that will happen some random number of times during a time interval, it is common to use the Poisson distribution. Given that we know the average number of goals scored by teams in our dataset (1.42), we can simply plug that into R’s dpois function and it will give us the probability of 0 goals, 1 goal, 2 goals, and so forth. Then we can compare these probabilities with the actual observed relative frequency of each score:\n\n\n\nSo what’s going on? Poisson is overpredicting scores of 1, 2 and 3, but underpredicting 0, 4, 5, and all higher scores up to infinity. This is a problem known as overdispersion. The Poisson distribution relies on an assumption that the mean is equal to the variance. In reality, this assumption is rarely satisfied. Indeed, the variance of our football scores is 1.65 compared to the mean of 1.42. That’s why the actual scores are more spread out (more 0s, more 5s and 6s) compared to the Poisson predictions (more 1s and 2s).\nThis is where the negative binomial distribution comes to our rescue! The negative binomial distribution in its most common form would be used to model things like “if I have a 70% chance of making each free throw, what is the probability that I miss exactly 5 free throws before I make my 10th successful free throw?” Anyone who took an undergraduate probability class will be familiar with fun questions like that.\nBut the negative binomial distribution can be expressed in a different way to make it very similar to the Poisson distribution so that it has a mean but also an additional parameter which is known (amongst other things) as the dispersion parameter. This allows us to build a Poisson-like distribution but to toggle the shape by changing . The two distributions are related - in fact, if you keep increasing *, the negative binomial gets closer and closer to Poisson.\nBelow I have added the negative binomial distribution (with *= 10) alongside the Poisson and the actual observed results:\n\n\n\nNot bad! We instantly see that this is a huge improvement over Poisson, and honestly does a pretty good job on every scoreline. To demonstrate how increasing affects the negative binomial distribution, here is the same plot with = 10,000. It is now indistinguishable from the Poisson distribution:\n\n\n\nSo we’re done, right? Just use a negative binomial distribution with *= 10 to model football scores. Not so simple, I’m afraid! That would be making an assumption that you can generate a score for team A, and then generate a score for team B, as if the two things happen independently. But is that a fair assumption?\nTo test that assumption we need to look at the conditional distribution of a team once we know how many goals their opponents have scored:\n\n\n\nSo now we can see there is a problem. When the opponent has scored 0, the distribution underestimates 0. When the opponent has scored 1, the distribution underestimates 1. When the opponent has scored 2, the distribution underestimates 2, and so on.\nSo in actual football, there are more draws than would be expected by two independent scores. This is not hard to explain: when a game is level, teams will take relatively fewer risks. When a team is trailing by one goal, they will throw men forward and make the game more open in pursuit of an equaliser. So the overall effect is that results are slightly more likely to settle on draws.\nWe also have another problem that we haven’t addressed yet. We are generating scores for an aggregate of all teams in our dataset. But teams’ abilities can vary significantly! So we need an algorithm that gives us the mean and distribution for one team, based on the difference in the teams’ Elo ratings, and then the mean and distribution for the second team, based not only on the Elo ratings but also on the score of the first team!\nThe simplest way to approach this is by first generating the score of the favourite (i.e. the team with the higher Elo rating after home advantage has been applied). I fit this with a simple quadratic model of the difference in Elo ratings. Below we can see how this compares with the negative binomial with *= 35. Remember, this is now an aggregation of different predictions across all of the games in the dataset.\n\n\n\nPretty good! So the favourites at least seem to be sorted, and we can see that the negative binomial with *= 35 is superior to Poisson. But what about the underdog? It’s slightly more complex to fit the underdog’s mean goals scored because now we have to account for the number of goals scored by the favourite. In addition, I added interaction terms to the quadratic model. A simple way to explain this is, if Real Madrid were playing against Tranmere Rovers and I told you Real Madrid scored 3 goals, would it change your prediction of how many Tranmere scored? Probably not much. If I told you Tranmere scored 3? Clearly your estimated for Real Madrid scoring 3+ should increase. So that is an interaction between two variables.\nSo let’s see how the underdog scores come out, conditional on the goals scored by the favourite:\n\n\n\nSo clearly there is a problem. I tried a few different values of - the above plots are with = 5 because that’s a good fit when the favourite scores 0. But it’s a poor fit for the other scores. So what we probably need is a different *depending on the favourite’s score!\nI trained a function to find the optimal *for each value of the favourite’s score, and these were the results:\nFav Goals | Theta\n0 | 8.4 1 | 35.3 2 | 61.3 3 | 10000\nLet’s see how the conditional plots look with these fitted dispersions:\n\n\n\nAs Roy Walker would say: “It’s good, but it’s not the one.” So now it’s time to use some brute force. We know that the underdog’s score is more likely to match the favourite’s score, so let’s do exactly that. I repeated the last optimization, but this time with an extra parameter that inflates the probability of the same score as the favourite. Here are the results:\n0 | 569 | 0.0935 1 | 14.1 | 0.0496 2 | 321 | 0.00894 3 | 198 | 0.00588\nSo when the favourite scores 0, there is a big boost to the probability of the underdog scoring 0. When the favourite scores 1, the effect reduces by almost half. For 2 or more goals, the inflation is minimal.\nNow how does that look in the conditional distribution?\n\n\n\nI’m pretty happy with that overall. The scores seem to track pretty well, so we can now generate a probability for every scoreline (0-0, 2-1, 3-3, etc) for every game in the dataset and derive probabilities of win-draw-loss for each team. Let’s calibrate our model by comparing these probabilties with the actual results and scores:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deciles track pretty nicely with our dashed line falling inside all the error bars except one. Note that the probabilities are different to the earlier decile plot because that one was using “half wins” when a game was drawn, whereas this plot assumes a draw is not a win (i.e. 0, the same as a loss).\nThe W-D-L plot and correct scores plot are close…there just seems to be a stubborn difference in the 1-1 predictions for some reason. But for the task at hand, this is easily adequate.\nWhat we have found in this process is somewhat similar to the Dixon-Coles model which uses a Poisson distribution with inflated probabilities of low scores (0-0, 0-1, 1-1, 1-0). Please check out their work as it will be far more mathematically rigorous than anything I have done here.\nThanks for reading, and as I mentioned earlier, you can find all the code relating to this project at my GitHub repo.\n\nData Sources\nI gather match data from a variety of public sources. Please check out these excellent websites:\n\nClub Elo Ratings\nESPN\nFBref\nFotMob\nTransfermarkt\nUnderstat\nWhoScored\nWorld Football Elo Ratings\n\nI welcome feedback!
