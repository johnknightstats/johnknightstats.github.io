    "title": "Set pieces are on the rise in football - but is this a good thing?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Watching English football lately it feels like there has been a set-piece explosion, with half the goals on any given weekend coming from corners or long throws. The reliance on scoring from set pieces seems like it has also removed a bit of the risk-taking from teams’ tactical approaches, resulting in a slightly duller overall product. I think this can and should be addressed, and I will have a little rant about officiating later in the article. But first, what do the statistics say about how football is changing with regard to open play and set pieces? And which teams are benefitting the most?\nFotMob publishes data for open-play xG and set-piece xG as far back as the 2020-2021 season. Using this data, let’s first take a look at the open-play and set-piece xG per match for each of the last six seasons. I have added a linear regression trend line (calculated at match level, not season level) that uses the date as an independent variable, to show whether the overall trend over those seasons has been increasing or decreasing.\n(I have used xG rather than goals for all analysis in this article; if you sub in goals instead, the trends are basically the same, but variance is higher).\nBoth open-play and set-piece xG have an overall upward trend of 0.03 per match per season, with a high level of statistical significance (low p-values). But what also jumps out is that open-play xG increased dramatically in 2023-24, and has declined in the two seasons since.\nThis is interesting, but before we start fishing for narratives, let’s put this in the context of the all-time goals per game by season in the English top flight.\nIt seems like 2023-24 was quite a big outlier. Since the early 1970s when Catenaccio and pressing nullified the free-flowing attacks of the 60s, the number of goals had been fairly stable until it suddenly shot up in 2023. Why? Without digging too deep into it, my feeling is that this season was the peak of the “play it out dangerously from the back” movement aligned with the “aggressive high press” movement. A perfect storm.\nPerhaps another time I will look more closely at that season, but focusing on the current topic, I am interested to see how the Premier League’s trends for open-play and set-piece xG compare with the other major European leagues over the past six seasons.\nFirst, let’s look at open play.\nLigue 1, the Champions League, and La Liga all had a greater upward trend than the Premier League. Meanwhile, Serie A, which had done a reasonable job of shedding its reputation for dull football, has declined at a rate of 0.07 open-play xG per season.\nNow we can look at the same for set-piece xG.\nAlong with the Premier League, the Bundesliga has also increased its set piece output at a similar rate, and there is a bit of separation between these leagues and the others."

    "text": "Where are the set-piece goals coming from?\nSo set pieces are on the rise in England, but which teams are benefitting the most? From casual observance, it feels like Arsenal have scored about twice as many set pieces as any other team.\nThat’s not quite the case, but Arsenal do lead the way with 14 goals, followed by Manchester United.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPremier League set-piece leaders (2025–26)\n\n\nTeam\nSet Piece Goals\nSet Piece xG\n\n\n\n\nArsenal\n14\n11.40\n\n\nManchester United\n13\n9.89\n\n\nLeeds United\n12\n10.77\n\n\nChelsea\n12\n9.13\n\n\nNewcastle United\n11\n10.58\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n11\n7.99\n\n\nAFC Bournemouth\n10\n9.90\n\n\nCrystal Palace\n9\n9.28\n\n\nAston Villa\n9\n6.57\n\n\nEverton\n8\n8.75\n\n\nWest Ham United\n8\n7.73\n\n\nSunderland\n8\n7.19\n\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion\n7\n7.23\n\n\nFulham\n7\n5.65\n\n\nManchester City\n6\n6.80\n\n\nBrentford\n5\n9.12\n\n\nBurnley\n5\n6.05\n\n\nNottingham Forest\n5\n4.95\n\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n4\n4.97\n\n\nLiverpool\n3\n4.84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the other end, there are multiple theories behind Liverpool’s struggles this season, but being rock bottom with only three set piece goals and 4.84 xG clearly has not helped.\nIn its shot data, FotMob further breaks down set pieces into four categories: corners, long throws, direct free kicks, and other set pieces. So we can also look at where the set piece increase has come from over the last six seasons.\n\n\n\nThe overall trend for both corners and long throws is the same, +0.02. But if you look closely at the dots, corners actually peaked in 2022-23 and have slightly declined since. Meanwhile, long throws were almost non-existent in 2020-21 and have gone through the roof this season. Direct free kick xG, interestingly, seems to be trending down.\nLong throws are the new hot thing, but which team is leading the way? The answer probably won’t surprise you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPremier League long-throw leaders (2025–26)\n\n\nTeam\nLong Throw Goals\nLong Throw xG\n\n\n\n\nBrentford\n3\n3.30\n\n\nCrystal Palace\n3\n2.92\n\n\nSunderland\n3\n2.88\n\n\nBurnley\n3\n1.57\n\n\nLeeds United\n2\n2.91\n\n\nAFC Bournemouth\n2\n2.46\n\n\nNewcastle United\n2\n2.03\n\n\nEverton\n2\n1.76\n\n\nManchester United\n2\n1.70\n\n\nAston Villa\n1\n1.10\n\n\nLiverpool\n1\n0.19\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n0\n0.95\n\n\nArsenal\n0\n0.81\n\n\nNottingham Forest\n0\n0.59\n\n\nChelsea\n0\n0.50\n\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n0\n0.41\n\n\nFulham\n0\n0.41\n\n\nWest Ham United\n0\n0.25\n\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion\n0\n0.24\n\n\nManchester City\n0\n0.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrentford, pioneers of the set piece movement and with former set piece coach Keith Andrews now as their manager, lead the way with three goals and 3.3 xG from long throws. It is notable that most of the teams near the top of the list are among the smaller clubs in the division, suggesting that long throws are a bit of a leveller.\nFinally, I was interested to see how English teams are performing in Europe with regard to open play and set pieces. The general narrative is that the Premier League is packed with physical beasts playing hurly burly in the penalty area each week, and the poor little technically-gifted Europeans aren’t able to deal with it.\nHow does that tally with the stats? Let’s look at how open-play and set-piece xG have changed in UEFA competitions in games between English teams and non-English opposition.\n\n\n\nYou will notice that the error bars are a bit larger in this plot; it’s obviously a much smaller sample than the league matches.\nNonetheless, there is a significant increase in set-piece xG for the English teams of 0.02 per match per season. Again, look more closely at the dots and we can see a large change in the current season: set-piece xG has increased, while open-play xG both for and against has decreased."

    "section": "A rant about referees and applying the laws of the game",
    "text": "A rant about referees and applying the laws of the game\nThat fits the overall sense of the recent English shift towards more cautious football with an emphasis on set pieces. Everyone will have their own opinion on this. Personally, I think if you want to watch players wrestling and blocking each other while they wait for someone to launch a ball at them, there are other sports where you can enjoy that. And tellingly, those sports tend to use an egg-shaped ball to add even more fun & randomness to these chaotic sequences!\nFootball, on the other hand, with its round ball, bills itself as the “beautiful game”. And while the clash of different styles remains an important part of football, the authorities have always had the power to tinker with the rules (or the application thereof) to steer the game in a desired direction. Hence you can no longer just kick the shit out of the opposition’s star player.\nSomething that has become evident over the past few seasons is that referees have decided to allow players to obstruct the goalkeeper. In fact it is now de rigueur to assign one player at every corner whose sole job is to block the keeper from being able to come out and challenge for the ball.\nWhy allow this to happen? I suppose the simple logic is that set piece goals are nonetheless goals, and more goals = more entertainment? But sometimes changes have unintended consequences, and if managers realise they can rely a bit more on these set piece goals and a bit less on attacking from open play, then the overall product suffers.\nThe good news is, we don’t need to scratch our heads to find a solution here. The FA can simply issue an edict instructing referees to actually apply the obstruction law.\n\nIMPEDING THE PROGRESS OF AN OPPONENT WITHOUT CONTACT\nImpeding the progress of an opponent means moving into the opponent’s path to obstruct, block, slow down or force a change of direction when the ball is not within playing distance of either player.\n\n\nAll players have a right to their position on the field of play; being in the way of an opponent is not the same as moving into the way of an opponent.\n\nBased on that law, is it an offence for an attacking player to block the goalkeeper at a corner? Clearly, the ball is not within playing distance and the goalkeeper’s progress is being impeded - he wants to come out and claim the ball but he is obstructed, blocked, slowed down, forced to change direction, or all of the above.\nSo the crux of the matter seems to be the “all players have a right to their position on the field of play” clause. This is the loophole being exploited. The “I’ve got to stand somewhere!” excuse.\nBut who is really buying this? The player is there solely to obstruct the goalkeeper. I know it, you know it, the referee knows it. And by and large, the player does move into the way of the keeper anyway, just before the corner is struck so as to minimize his ability to navigate around the blocker.\nFurthermore, importantly, the above law applies without contact! Deliberately blocking off the keeper should be an infringement even if you don’t touch him - yet they are allowing players to pin the keeper on his line with a load of contact thrown into the bargain.\nI recommend this article from last year by Profspur for a more broad, eloquent argument on this topic. Personally, I find it baffling and frustrating, and I assume there will be a growing discontent over set pieces - not least over the time spent with the ball out of play while they are setting them up like something from an NFL playbook. In the meantime, I can pull my hair out each week while the experts in the studio tell us the keeper “just needs to be stronger”.\n\nData Sources\nI gather match data from a variety of public sources.

    "section": "",
    "text": "There are three different camps when it comes to VAR in football. Those, like me, who have been against VAR from day one: I think it ruins the excitement of goals and creates unrealistic expectations of forensic-level accuracy over every decision. There are also those who think VAR is fantastic and are very happy with it. I mean, I’ve never met those people, but they must exist. And the third camp consists of those who think VAR is a good idea, if only those pesky humans operating it weren’t so incompetent!\nThe problem with that last group is, I’m not sure people are being realistic in terms of how easy it is to get refereeing decisions right.\nThis BBC article describes the increase in VAR errors in the first half of the current Premier League season, and lists the 13 VAR “mistakes”, 11 of which were missed interventions and two of which were incorrect interventions.\nAfter giving details of each incident, the article also shows a running total of which teams have suffered from or gained from these errors, just to pour a bit more petrol on the bonfire of those who think the world is conspiring against their team. Football supporters have never been renowned for their objectivity.\nThe mistakes are identified by the Key Match Incidents (KMI) Panel which meets every week to adjudicate on all key decisions in Premier League matches. The panel consists of one representative each from the Premier League and Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), as well as three from a rotating pool of former players and managers including the likes of Karen Carney, Rob Green, Terry Burton, Jonathan Walters and Steven Reid.\nWe will gloss over the suitability of those individuals for the panel - judging by the general standard of punditry and co-commentary from ex-players on TV, the bar is not high - but even if we respect the judgement of the panel, what are the statistics behind these mistakes actually showing us?\nAccording to the BBC article, here is the breakdown of the panel’s votes on the 13 VAR errors:\nPanel split\nFrequency\n%\n\n\n\n\n5–0\n3\n23.1\n\n\n4–1\n3\n23.1\n\n\n3–2\n7\n53.8\nMore than half the ‘mistakes’ were only decided by a 3-2 panel verdict.\nEvidently, of the 13 decisions branded as mistakes, only three of them were unanimous 5-0 decisions by the KMI Panel. Three of them had one dissenter in a 4-1 decision and in more than half of the so-called mistakes, the panel was split 3-2! So can we really say that the referees got it wrong? What if the panel got it wrong?"

    "title": "Are referees judged harshly with respect to VAR?",
    "section": "A Bayesian approach",
    "text": "A Bayesian approach\nThe language surrounding refereeing decisions in football can be quite binary and hyperbolic. You will often hear “that’s a stonewall penalty”, or “never a pen in a million years”; sometimes about the same decision!\nThe fact that the panel of experts failed to unanimously agree on most of the cases shows that reality is not so clear-cut. It is reasonable to consider each refereeing decision not as a simple case of right or wrong, but instead as having a probability somewhere between 0 and 1 of being incorrect.\nUnder that assumption, we can model the KMI Panel’s voting split as a beta-binomial distribution, where the underlying probability of the decision being incorrect follows a beta distribution, and then our five expert panelists are treated as independent Bernoulli draws and may vote correct or incorrect based on that underlying probability.\nUnfortunately we don’t have the full data relating to the KMI Panel’s votes on every case, only on the mistakes, so we can’t derive the full distribution. But what we can do is use a few different example priors, and show what our posterior probability would be of the referee’s decision being incorrect after a 3-2, 4-1, or 5-0 vote.\nThe obvious starting point for the prior is the uniform beta (1,1). This is a flat line: we simply don’t know anything about the probability of the referee’s decision being correct or incorrect. But this also implies a 50% overall probability of the referee’s decision being wrong, which is too high; we know from the article that there were, at minimum, 49 VAR interventions, plus other cases the panel considered while only finding 13 to be mistakes.\nThe second and third beta distributions I have chosen assume a mean of 0.1 probability that the referee’s decision was incorrect. They vary in shape: the second distribution is a downward curve, while the third distribution is U-shaped, reflecting a larger frequency near 0 and 1: your stonewall and never-in-a-million-years decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these three prior distributions we can calculate the posterior probability of the ref’s decision being wrong, conditional on the panel’s votes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-0\n4-1\n3-2\n\n\n\n\nBeta(0.05, 0.45)\n0.92\n0.74\n0.55\n\n\nBeta(0.3, 2.7)\n0.66\n0.54\n0.41\n\n\nBeta(1.0, 1.0)\n0.86\n0.71\n0.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean posterior probability of decision being incorrect, conditional on observed panel decision.\n\nSo, depending on your prior, the maximum estimate of the probability of an incorrect decision based on the panel’s vote would be 92% for 5-0, 74% for 4-1, and 57% for 3-2: not far off a coin flip!\nThis sort of thing highlights a wider problem with statistics which is that there are different ways to spin the exact same result. The BBC have gone with “VAR mistakes are on the rise!” whereas I look at the panel’s voting splits and think this just shows you how difficult a referee’s job is: even a panel of experts, with all the time in the world, cannot agree what is the correct decision.\nSo what is a better approach? Stop reporting 3-2 decisions as errors. At minimum, I think they should require at least a 4-1 vote for a decision to be declared incorrect, and preferably 5-0. This is in line with the “clear and obvious error” spirit that everyone seems to be in favour of (until there is a decision they don’t like).\nA similar system exists in a jury, where all 12 members have to agree to reach a guilty verdict. Perhaps we should have a VAR jury in the Premier League? Five different refs sat in different rooms, and a 4-1 majority required to overturn the on-field decision.\nNonetheless, I feel like the accuracy of VAR is a red herring. The overall accuracy of decisions has improved compared to pre-VAR, and yet nobody seems happier. There will continue to be incremental improvements, but that will just move us to a new frontier of what everyone will complain about; we can already look forward to VAR reviews of corners. Exciting!\nThose who anticipated VAR ushering in a new era without weekly officiating controversies were sadly mistaken. We did lose a lot of the spontaneous elation when a goal is scored - the new normal is that your team has probably scored, but you are worried about that pass in the buildup where the winger had maybe strayed half a yard offside. Scoring is now more like getting a penalty: there’s a good chance we are getting a goal here. Was it worth the trade? Not for me.\n\nData Sources\nI gather match data from a variety of public sources.

    "text": "Visualizing rail travel times from the centre of London to surrounding stations with the use of Python, SQLite and the folium package.\n\nRecently, I took a train from Waterloo station to Woking to play a round of golf in Surrey. I’ve taken this route before, and Woking is a relatively easy place to get to because of the abundance of fast trains departing from Waterloo.\n\n Woking: a superstar of the London commuting scene.Picture credit: Kennedy News and Media.\n\nNo doubt this makes Woking a hotbed for London commuters looking to escape the inflated house prices in the capital. But how does Woking’s train service compare with other London satellite towns?\n\nA Project for Python\nI calculated and visualized the travel times to each station in London and the surrounding area using the following steps in Python:\n\nDownload free timetable and station data in JSON format from Network Rail.\nCreate relational tables for schedules and TIPLOCs (railway codes) in SQLite.\nFilter for trains departing from one of the 13 London terminals: Blackfriars, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Euston, Fenchurch Street, King’s Cross, Liverpool Street, London Bridge, Marylebone, Paddington, St. Pancras, Victoria or Waterloo.\nCalculate the mean expected time from a traveller’s arrival at one of the terminals to reaching their destination.\nVisualize the time to each station on a map using the folium library, with green representing a shorter time and red a longer time.\n\nHere is the map:\n\n\n\n\nHow was this calculated?\nLet me expand a little more on the calculation of the times. I wanted a fair way to capture both the frequency and the speed of each train service.\nSuppose you arrive at a London terminal at a random time on a Tuesday between 5:00pm and 7:00pm - typical for someone returning from a day’s work or shopping. You board the next available train with the earliest arrival time at your destination. For example, let’s say I arrived at Waterloo at 5:35pm and the next train to Woking was at 5:40pm. If the train then took 24 minutes to reach Woking (6:04pm arrival) my total elapsed time is 29 minutes.\nI calculated this for each of the 120 minutes (i.e. one simulation per minute) from 5:00pm to 7:00pm and averaged them to get the expected time to each destination.\n\n\nObservations\nIt goes without saying, the general trend is for stations close to the centre of London to have shorter journey times. If you live in Bethnal Green, you’re in luck - it’s less than 10 minutes from Liverpool Street.\nOf course, Bethnal Green is hardly cheap nowadays. The more interesting stations are those further outside London which nonetheless have reasonable expected arrival times. Woking, to the south west of London for those unfamiliar with the home counties, stands out as one of the few solid green dots outside the M25 ringroad.\nMoving clockwise around the outside of the M25, we see similar green dots at Reading, St. Albans, Harpenden, Cheshunt, Broxbourne, Shenfield, Ebbsfleet and Sevenoaks. All these towns have an expected arrival time of less than 33 minutes from arriving at the original station, and might be attractive options for people working in London but looking for more affordable housing.\nSome considerations:\n\nI’m sure the train service to these towns is no secret, and house prices will be higher as a result.\nTrain ticket prices may be higher as you go further outside London.\nLondon Underground stations could be added for a more complete picture.\n\nI may revisit this analysis in future to incorporate house prices, travel cost, and tube stops. Nonetheless, I think it’s an interesting and useful visualization. I hope you agree!

    "section": "",
    "text": "Creating a logistic regression model to predict the chance of scoring a goal in each minute of a football match based on the pre-match odds, current score, minutes elapsed, and any red cards.\n\nWhen is a football team most likely to score? My simple hypothesis would consist of:\n\nThe chance of scoring increases as the game goes on.\nTeams who are ahead are less likely to score than teams who are behind.\n\nBut what does the data say?\nI looked at goal times from the big 5 European leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France) since 2017 - a total of 38,882 goals from 14,357 games.\n\nWhat to do about injury time?\nA tricky part of goal times in football is how to deal with injury time. Conventionally, these are often recorded as 45’ for a goal in first half injury time and 90’ for second half injury time, so you naturally end up with larger goal totals in these minutes, leading to artificial spikes that distort time-based goal patterns.\nIt might be possible to consider each injury time minute individually, but that would require knowing exactly which minutes were played in full, and which were ended after, say, 15 seconds. I don’t currently have that level of detail, so I decided to ignore injury time goals for the purpose of this analysis, guaranteeing that the 90 minutes could all be treated equally.\nFirstly, here is a summary of the goals in each of the 90 minutes:\n\n\n\nAs expected, we see an upward trend, with understandably low totals at the start of each half as it’s harder to score when each team’s entire XI start in their own half of the pitch.\nBut what’s that patch of high totals between 48 and 58 minutes? Why would there be a stretch of unusually high scoring just after half time like this? I double-checked for data errors but it appears to be correct - we will come back to this apparent anomaly a little later.\nNext, here is the same chart but showing expected goals (xG) instead of goals. The trend closely mirrors the goals chart, but with much lower variance. I will continue using goals for this particular analysis, but this is a good demonstration of why xG is so useful in statistical analysis of football: lowering variance is generally a good thing!\n\n\n\n\n\nGame state\nSo why does scoring tend to increase as a game progresses? One obvious factor is that every game starts off at 0-0, and scores are more likely to be level early in games than later on. Here is a summary of the scoreline by minute:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, for almost the entire first half a level scoreline is most common, and thereafter it is more frequently a one-goal lead for either team. If level games are generally tighter and more defensive than games where one team is leading, then that would explain the lower scoring early in games.\nWhen we look at a smoothed plot of scoring rate categorised by lead, we can see that teams with a two-goal lead score at the highest rate, followed by teams with a one-goal lead. (I would ignore the trends for -2 and +2 early in the game, due to small sample issues)\n\n\n\nThe problem here is we have an additional factor: team strength. If a team is leading by two goals, then it is more likely that they are simply a better team than their opponent, and hence more likely to score next. So we need to also account for the quality of the teams.\nI divided all teams into quartiles based on their pre-match bookmaker odds, with quartile 4 containing the strongest teams and quartile 1 the weakest:\n\n\n\n\n\nTime for a regression\nNow let’s bring everything together. The simplest way to estimate the effects of several variables when applied simultaneously is with a multiple regression. In this case we will use a logistic regression, since the outcome is binary (0 goals or 1 goal).\nThe current lead in each minute was categorized with a minimum of “-2 or less” and a maximum of “2 or more”. Additional features in the model were the minute, pre-match odds (converted to probability), and red cards for and against.\nI decided to create separate models for the first and second halves, since the shape of some of the plots suggested it may not be a simple linear relationship for 90 minutes. Based on the low scoring in minutes 1, 2, 46 and 47, I also included dummy variables for minute 1 and minute 2 of each half.\nFinally, for each half I trained a second model including interactions between lead and minute, lead and pre-match odds, and between lead and red cards for and against. After inspecting the interaction terms’ p-values, plus a likelihood ratio test and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), it seemed like the simpler model was about the same. If in doubt, always stick with the simpler model!\n\n Logistic Regression: First Half                       Coefficient       Std.

And the Intercept is only used when making predictions, otherwise that isn’t too relevant.\nEach coefficient represents the associated change in log odds of scoring a goal - a positive coefficient means the chances of a goal increase as this variable increases, and vice versa.\nFirstly, we can see that teams leading by 1 have a lower coefficient (-0.132) than the other scorelines. This means teams with a one-goal lead are the least likely to score, all other things being equal.\nThe first two minutes of the half, as expected, have lower scoring, and then there is a small increase (0.004) for each minute as the half progresses. A red card (-0.766) reduces the chance of scoring more than an opposition red card (0.536) increases it. Predictably, pre-match win probability (1.752) is a strong positive predictor of scoring rate.\n\n Logistic Regression: Second Half                       Coefficient       Std.

We can also see that the effect of each additional minute is actually slightly negative now (-0.001).\nTo demonstrate these results, I used the median of each quartile of pre-match odds and predicted each minute of the game with scorelines of -1, 0, and 1, with no red cards:\n\n\n\nIf a strong favourite (white line) was playing against an underdog (dark blue line), we can see that if the favourite were trailing by one goal in the second half, their probability of scoring in each minute would increase significantly more than the associated decrease in the underdog’s chance of scoring. This intuitively feels correct: favourites often ramp up the pressure when chasing an equaliser.\n\n\nSummary of findings\n\nTeams are relatively more likely to score when trailing than when level, and more likely to score when level than when leading.\nIn the first half, scoring rate increases as the half progresses, all other things being equal.\nWhen the teams come out for the second half, scoring rate jumps higher than it was in the 45th minute, and then gradually decreases as the half progresses.\n\n\n\nWhat about those high values in the 48th-58th minute?\nIf we revisit the first plot in this article, the unusually high values between 48 and 58 minutes can now be understood. I have added a red line to the plot which now looks like a slight downward trend in the second half, rather than a series of observations above the overall trend:\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\nThere are, of course, some limitations to this analysis. Injury time in both halves has been ignored, as have factors like league- or game-specific goal totals. There is also the question of whether goals beget more goals: all other things being equal, does a scoreline of 1-1 tend to predict more goals than a scoreline of 0-0?\nThere is plenty more scope to drill down in a future analysis, but this gives us a nice framework to build on.

    "title": "Unai Emery: the xG whisperer",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is part two of a multi-part look at Unai Emery and his apparent habit of outperforming expected goals (xG). In part one, I showed that xG is a more predictive statistic than points or goal difference, and that Emery ranks third among all managers for xG overperformance during the study period (2017-2018 to 2024-2025).\nNext, I want to drill down on Emery’s stints at PSG, Arsenal, Villarreal and Aston Villa during those seasons. We know from part one that his teams, cumulatively, have scored more than their expected goals for, and conceded fewer than their expected goals against. But where have these gains come from?\nAn obvious starting point is to break it down by club. Here we can see a breakdown of Emery’s total xG overperformance at each of the four clubs, with attacking overperformance in blue and defensive overperformance in orange.\nAll four clubs, with Emery as manager, have performed better than their xG in both attack and defence. The largest overperformance came at Aston Villa where, up to the end of the 2024-2025 season, Emery outperformed xG by 31.7 goals. With both Villa and PSG, the majority of overperformance came in attack, whereas at Villarreal the majority was on the defensive end. At Arsenal it was close to a 50:50 split.\nThere is an obvious question to be raised, especially with respect to PSG and Arsenal: is this just about having better players? These are wealthy clubs that can sign better-than-average footballers in every position; it’s no wonder that they will excel at whatever aspects of the game the xG models cannot capture.\nThis is a fair point, so let’s take a look at how these clubs have performed, relative to xG, with and without Unai Emery as manager during the study period:\nUnai Emery xG overperformance by club relative to other managers (2017-2025)\n\n\nClub\nMatches (Emery)\nxG overperformance per match (Emery)\nMatches (Other)\nxG overperformance per match (Other)\n\n\n\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n46\n0.624\n323\n0.309\n\n\nArsenal\n71\n0.300\n316\n0.201\n\n\nAston Villa\n125\n0.254\n127\n0.015\n\n\nVillarreal\n117\n0.202\n249\n0.027\n\n\n\nxG overperformance = goals minus expected goals.\nAgain, I want to reiterate that this is a measure of goals relative to xG - it does NOT measure whether the xG is high or low in the first place. Just because Emery outperformed his xG by an average of 0.3 at Arsenal, does not mean he got better results overall than the managers that outperformed their xG by an average of 0.201.\nNonetheless, it is clear that Emery has done better, relative to xG, at each of the four clubs than all the other managers collectively. It is also evident that PSG and Arsenal have outperformed xG (by 0.309 and 0.201 per game, respectively, without Emery) across all managers, whereas Aston Villa and Villarreal are close to neutral under non-Emery managers, backing up the hypothesis that wealth begets talent which begets xG overperformance."

Because Durán arrived at Villa from MLS and left to Saudi Arabia, we do not have any non-Emery results for him in the dataset for comparison.\nOf the 10 names on the list, only Neymar and Alexandre Lacazette recorded a positive xG overperformance under other managers. Edinson Cavani underperformed his xG in subsequent seasons with PSG, Man Utd and Valencia. Ollie Watkins has now established himself as a star striker at Emery’s Villa, but had previously been seen by many as a hard-working forward but a mediocre finisher.\nAlex Baena, meanwhile, experienced an outrageous run of finishing in his short time playing for Emery’s Villarreal, scoring 9 times from only 37 shots and gaining 6.31 goals over xG; yet without Emery, his shooting boots deserted him, completely negating the hot run (-6.45 goals). Yeremy Pino, now of Crystal Palace, experience a similar turnaround (+3.92 to -6.18) as did Gerard Moreno (+4.58 to -4.69).\nThe impact of defenders on opposition finishing is a bit harder to quantify, but we can take a look at goalkeepers. Post-shot expected goals (PSxG) can be used to model the probability of a goal being scored after the ball is struck (an off-target shot therefore being worth zero) and we can calculate a goalkeeper’s “goals prevented” by subtracting the actual number of goals conceded from their total PSxG.

    "title": "Unai Emery: the xG whisperer",
    "section": "Game state",
    "text": "Game state\nSomething that gets neglected when people throw around aggregated statistics is context. A team that is down by one goal has very different incentives than a team that is leading by one goal, and will vary their tactics accordingly. We can break down Unai Emery’s teams by game state (i.e. the number of goals they are leading or trailing by at any point in the match) and see how their xG overperformance varies.\n\n\n\nIn attack, Emery’s teams tend to overperform their xG per shot in close games (leading by one, trailing by one, or level). In defence, they tend to overperform across the board.\nThe orange bars show the overall distribution for all teams: in attack, outperforming xG when leading, and underperforming xG when trailing. The trend is mirrored in defence, because one team’s attack is always another team’s defence. The implication here is intuitive: when you are chasing an equaliser, the opposition will keep more players back, and there will be less space to get shots off; players are more crowded and have to shoot quickly under duress. When leading, they are more likely to find themselves in friendly situations with fewer defenders back.\nBut there’s an obvious problem with these overall aggregated statistics. Good teams tend to be ahead more often, and bad teams tend to be behind, so this is likely to bias the results.\nTo account for this bias, I trained a regression model that used the log of the match odds (adjusted to remove the bookmaker’s overround) to represent the relative strengths of the two teams. The outcome variable was the difference between goals and xG on each shot, with game state, team strength and Emery as features along with interactions to capture different effects at each game state.\n\n\n\nAfter accounting for team strength, Emery’s teams overperformed xG in attack by 0.024 goals per shot when trailing by one goal, and 0.013 per shot when leading by one goal. They actually underperformed in games that were not close (2 or more goal lead for either team).\n\n\n\nIn defence, the largest overperformance was when trailing by two goals (+0.035 goals per shot) followed by one goal (+0.026). So when Emery’s teams were behind by one goal, they outperformed xG by similar amounts both offensively and defensively, and this is the scoreline at which Emery seems to create the biggest edge.\nThese amounts may sound small, but when you bear in mind that the average shot has an xG of around 0.11, a difference of 0.024 per shot would be more than a 20% increase in the number of goals.\nThere is one aspect of Villa’s current season that I haven’t yet covered, and that is the conversion of a +9 goal difference into 42 points, the same number of points as Manchester City who have a goal difference of +26. The only way to do that is with a lot of one-goal wins, and unsurprisingly Villa lead the Premier League in that category with 10 one-goal wins after 21 matches played.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost one-goal wins, 2025-2026 Premier League\n\n\nTeam\nPlayed\nOne-goal wins\nTotal wins\n\n\n\n\nAston Villa\n21\n10\n13\n\n\nArsenal\n21\n8\n15\n\n\nFulham\n21\n7\n9\n\n\nLiverpool\n21\n6\n10\n\n\nNewcastle United\n21\n5\n9\n\n\nManchester United\n21\n5\n8\n\n\nSunderland\n21\n5\n7\n\n\nManchester City\n21\n4\n13\n\n\nEverton\n21\n4\n8\n\n\nCrystal Palace\n21\n4\n7\n\n\nAFC Bournemouth\n21\n4\n6\n\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion\n21\n3\n7\n\n\nBrentford\n21\n2\n10\n\n\nChelsea\n21\n2\n8\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n21\n2\n7\n\n\nNottingham Forest\n21\n2\n6\n\n\nLeeds United\n21\n2\n5\n\n\nBurnley\n21\n1\n3\n\n\nWest Ham United\n21\n1\n3\n\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n21\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo is this also a part of Emery’s repertoire? It is not unreasonable to suppose that a manager might set up his team in such a way that they play conservatively with the lead and aggressively without it, increasing the chance of winning by exactly one goal and earning a greater number of points than the team’s goal difference would imply. If that is the case with Emery then it should show up in his results in previous seasons across each of his clubs.\nI entered the final points and goal difference for each team in each season of the study period and as you can see below, the relationship is linear. I have plotted the GDPG and PPG for Emery’s stints at his four clubs, and while Aston Villa and Arsenal lie above the line, Villarreal and PSG lie underneath. So it doesn’t seem like Emery is able to consistently overshoot his goal difference.\n\n\n\nWe can also look at Emery’s previous seasons to see whether he really does have an unusual number of one-goal wins. The side-by-side column charts below compare the score distribution of Emery’s teams alongside the distribution of teams in a similar bin of overall goal difference per game. Emery actually had fewer one-goal wins than expected at PSG, Arsenal and Villarreal; only with Aston Villa did he exceed the expected number of one-goal wins."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As a football nerd, I love playing around on the Club Elo website. One little feature I noticed is that each club’s page shows their highest ever ranking, and when they most recently held that rank. This got me wondering: which British teams have reached #1 in the Elo rankings at some point in their history?\nWe know which British teams have been champions of Europe: Celtic, Manchester United, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa, Chelsea and Manchester City. But that doesn’t necessarily mean reaching #1 in Elo; Aston Villa, for example, only reached a highest ranking of 6th in the early 80s despite winning the English league title and European Cup.\nWhy so low? Because Villa had finished no better than 7th in the three seasons before their title, and finished 11th the following year - still the lowest ever league position for any winner of the European Cup or Champions League in the 70 years of the competition.\nYear\nWinners\nLeague Pos\n\n\n\n\n1980\nNottingham Forest\n5\n\n\n1981\nLiverpool\n5\n\n\n2000\nReal Madrid\n5\n\n\n2005\nLiverpool\n5\n\n\n1985\nJuventus\n6\n\n\n2012\nChelsea\n6\n\n\n1975\nBayern Munich\n10\n\n\n1982\nAston Villa\n11\nEuropean champions who finished 5th or lower in their domestic league that season.\nVilla fans won’t care about that, of course, because the purpose of sport is to win matches and trophies; the notion of being a “good team” is an abstract concept. Nonetheless, I like the Club Elo ratings as they provide an objective measure to compare teams, and they generally pass the eye test. In fact, Villa fans will be pleased to know the current side are ranked in 8th place, just two points behind Real Madrid.\nRank\nClub\nElo\n\n\n\n\n1\nArsenal\n2062\n\n\n2\nFC Bayern\n1996\n\n\n3\nParis SG\n1956\n\n\n4\nManchester City\n1954\n\n\n5\nLiverpool\n1949\n\n\n6\nBarcelona\n1942\n\n\n7\nReal Madrid\n1923\n\n\n8\nAston Villa\n1921\n\n\n9\nInternazionale\n1914\n\n\n10\nChelsea\n1896\nCurrent Elo ratings (27 Jan, 2026).\nAt first I was going to entitle this article “Which British teams have been the best in the world?” But of course, the Club Elo ratings don’t include teams outside Europe, which arguably wouldn’t affect the top teams today but certainly would have at various points in history. But even if the data included results from South American club football, would there be enough crossover between the two continents to make meaningful combined ratings? Doubtful.\nBefore I look at the British number ones, I think it’s interesting to see which countries have dominated across each decade.\nThe Club Elo rankings begin at the start of 1940, although it’s not clear how the first set of ratings are devised, or how much inter-league mixing there was prior to the start of the European Cup era in 1955. There were some international club competitions, such as the Latin Cup and Mitropa Cup, as well as various club friendlies. Famously, Wolverhampton Wanderers were proclaimed as Champions of the World by the Daily Mail in 1954 after beating Hungarian champions Honved 3-2.\nSpanish teams of course had the advantage in the early 1940s that everyone else was busy fighting World War Two. Once that conflict was decided, Italy soon took over top spot with the great Torino side reigning for more than two years before the tragic plane crash that killed their entire team in 1949.\nIt would be arduous to comment on every different club’s spell at the top (sorry, Malmo fans!), but the broad trends can be seen: the coffee shops of Vienna and Budapest in the 50s; the Real Madrid team that won the first five European Cups; the total football Dutch era; the English and German dominance of the 70s and 80s; the almost complete monopoly of the 1990s by Italy; and the back and forth between Spain and England since the turn of the century.\nEvery team has an interesting story to tell, and maybe I will take a similar look at the non-British teams in future. But for now, let’s run through each of the twelve British sides that reached top spot: how many days they have been #1, and when they did it."

This was followed by a relatively lean spell before the great Everton side of the 1980s emerged. The Toffees won the 1984 FA Cup and then in 1985, as mentioned in the Spurs section above, they went on a brilliant run after Christmas, winning 16 of 18 games to romp to the league title as well as winning the Cup Winners’ Cup and losing the FA Cup final to Manchester United in extra time. Bearing in mind the fixture load, it has to be one of the most impressive runs in English football history.\nEverton followed this up with second place in 1986 (Gary Lineker’s only season at the club) and then won the league again in 1987. Sadly, Everton were big losers from English clubs’ European ban following the Heysel disaster. In an era where England had won seven of the previous nine European Cup finals, they obviously would have had a great chance in both 1986 and 1988 - finalists in those years included Steaua Bucharest and Benfica.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nClub\nElo\n\n\n\n\n1\nLiverpool\n1898\n\n\n2\nEverton\n1895\n\n\n3\nReal Madrid\n1877\n\n\n4\nFC Bayern\n1868\n\n\n5\nWerder Bremen\n1823\n\n\n6\nJuventus\n1815\n\n\n7\nBarcelona\n1808\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n16\nSteaua Bucharest\n1769\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElo ratings on 6 May, 1986, the day before the European Cup final (Steaua Bucharest vs. Barcelona).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nClub\nElo\n\n\n\n\n1\nReal Madrid\n1928\n\n\n2\nLiverpool\n1919\n\n\n3\nFC Bayern\n1870\n\n\n4\nEverton\n1853\n\n\n5\nManchester United\n1851\n\n\n6\nPSV Eindhoven\n1844\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n31\nBenfica\n1724\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElo ratings on 24 May, 1988, the day before the European Cup final (PSV Eindhoven vs. Benfica)."

Almost as famous, or infamous, was their subsequent Intercontinental Cup tie against Racing Club of Argentina, marred by foul play and culminating in six players being sent off in the deciding playoff match.\nAlthough this Celtic team is predominantly associated with those two events, they reached #1 in the Elo ratings in all of the years from 1968 through to 1972. Celtic won nine consecutive Scottish titles from 1965-66 to 1973-74, adding four Scottish FA Cups and five Scottish League Cups in the same period.\nScottish domestic success can sometimes be scoffed at due to the lack of depth north of the border, but Celtic showed their pedigree in Europe, winning the European Cup in 1967 as well as losing the 1970 final to Feyenoord via a 117th-minute extra time goal. They also lost to eventual champions Milan in the 1969 quarter-finals, and likewise to Ajax in the 1971 quarter-finals, then lost to Inter on penalties in the 1972 semis.

Despite their success, this Leeds team are probably defined more by what they didn’t win than what they did win. They were runners-up in the league in three consecutive years from 1970 to 1972, aided by a controversial Jeff Astle goal for West Brom in 1971, and a final day defeat at Wolves in 1972 when a draw would have made them champions.\nIn UEFA competitions, the club’s two final defeats still leave a sour taste among Leeds fans today. The 1973 Cup Winners’ Cup final against AC Milan was marred by dubious officiating from a referee who was subsequently banned for life by UEFA. Then, in the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern Munich, Peter Lorimer had a goal disallowed as Billy Bremner was deemed to be standing in an offside position. Leeds were also denied what they felt was a blatant penalty, and the English fans responded to the perceived injustice in the usual fashion of the time: they rioted, and Leeds were banned from European competitions for four years (later reduced to two on appeal)."

Champions League revenue was a huge advantage, creating a feedback loop that allowed the same teams to secure the top four spots each year and another load of cash. In the six seasons from 2003-04 to 2008-09, Everton were the only other team to finish in the top four, taking advantage of a poor Liverpool season in 2005 to grab 4th place (with just 61 points and a negative goal difference!), before unfortunately losing to Villarreal in the Champions League qualifying round.\nGiven the level of spending, City’s trophy return was disappointing over the first nine seasons. They won two league titles - both thanks to enormous collapses, first by Manchester United in 2012 and then by Liverpool in 2014 - and the 2011 FA Cup where they beat Stoke City in the final.\nIt wasn’t until the arrival of Pep Guardiola that City truly became a consistently elite side. After a first bedding-in season, where the expert pundits questioned his decisions such as dropping Joe Hart, Guardiola rattled off six of the next seven league titles, amassing some huge points totals; Liverpool could only finish second in 2019 with 97 points!\nIt was in February 2021 that City finally gained the Elo #1 ranking for the first time in the club’s history, and they largely stayed there until the end of 2024 when Liverpool knocked them back off.\nIt is yet to be seen how the ruling over City’s 115 charges for financial misconduct will affect the club’s legacy. The stripping of titles doesn’t seem to be applied in team sports, because that’s not good for marketing, so a fine and/or points deduction seems more likely - that’s IF they are found guilty, of course. So whether or not people will add a notional asterisk next to their club honours list, it is nonetheless an amazing fact that Manchester City have won more major trophies under one manager (15) than they had won in the previous 136 years of the football club’s existence (14)."

Liverpool have been top of the Elo rankings for more than three times the number of days of any other British club.\nIt all started with Bill Shankly who took over the club in the second division in 1959, when Everton were the undisputed best team on Merseyside. Progress was swift: promotion in 1962 was followed by league titles in 1964 and 1966, and Liverpool have basically been a fixture near the top of the league table ever since.

Liverpool’s golden era overlaps almost perfectly with United’s barren run without a league title from 1967 to 1993, and then United’s domination in the 1990s and 2000s coincided with Liverpool’s decline, until the retirement of Alex Ferguson, after which United have struggled while Liverpool thrived in the Jurgen Klopp era. It’s like the footballing gods won’t allow them both to be good at the same time.\nLiverpool once again became a major force under Klopp, but surprisingly they did also sneak into #1 spot for four days in April 2009 under Rafa Benitez after an impressive run of results that included a 4-1 win at Manchester United, a 5-0 win over 5th-placed Aston Villa, and a 5-0 aggregate win over Real Madrid in the Champions League.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nClub\nElo\n\n\n\n\n1\nLiverpool\n1982\n\n\n2\nManchester United\n1979\n\n\n3\nBarcelona\n1952\n\n\n4\nChelsea\n1948\n\n\n5\nReal Madrid\n1900\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElo ratings on 5 April, 2009.

    "text": "Final Word\nThis was a fun exercise, and something that becomes clear is the differences between eras in terms of how strongly the English league is rated in comparison to other leagues. To get to number one in the Elo ratings, you not only have to be the best team in England, but you also need English teams to be highly-rated in general.\nFor example, the great Spurs side of the 1960s was not even close to being top of the Elo ratings despite being narrowly beaten by Benfica in the 1962 European Cup semi-finals, and then winning the Cup Winners’ Cup the following season.\nElo is a nice system because it is simple, objective and interpretable. But it can sometimes be too slow to update to new information, and clearly it took many years of English teams having good results in Europe before the ratings caught up. And so while certain teams racked up the days at the #1 spot, other teams such as Spurs, Manchester United and Leeds United were responsible for dragging the English league into relevance.\nAs for the future, the Premier League is obviously in a very strong position at the moment and it looks like whoever are the best team in England also have a pretty good chance of being ranked the best in Europe. So we could see teams start to make inroads into Liverpool’s lead, not only in the Elo stakes but also in the thing that matters: trophies. Liverpool currently have six European Cups - will another English team ever equal them? Arsenal getting to one would be a start; they will feel like this year is a good chance.\n\nData Sources\nI gather match data from a variety of public sources.

    "text": "Betting distribution tool\nTo help visualize this, I created a simple tool using R Shiny that compares two distribution curves based on the odds, number of bets and your perceived edge. One curve shows how results will be distributed if the market is correct, and the other if your price is correct.\nFor example, let’s say you are placing $100 bets at decimal odds of 2.0, when you believe the true price is 1.8. This means you think there is a 55.6% chance of the bet winning when the market says it is 50%, which is a very solid edge if you can find it consistently.\nAfter 100 bets, the curves look like this:\n\n 100 bets at 2.0 with a perceived “true” price of 1.8.\n\nNow, 100 bets is a lot! Especially if it’s a system that only throws up a handful of bets a week. This could be several months’ work - and yet clearly there is a lot of crossover between the two curves. You could quite feasibly be losing with a very good system, OR you could be showing a decent profit from pure guesses.\nAfter running the tool with the parameters mentioned above, the accompanying results table reveals that the probability of being in profit, if your prices are correct, is 86.82%. So that’s just over a 13% probability of being down after 100 bets despite having a pretty solid edge.\nIf we increase the number of bets to 1000, the two curves are now a lot more distinct, and the probability of an overall loss if your 1.8 price is correct is virtually nil:\n\n 1000 bets at 2.0 with a perceived “true” price of 1.8."

    "section": "Central limit theorem",
    "text": "Central limit theorem\nSo this is all great in theory, but what about in practice? Not all bets are placed at even money; would the distribution for other prices really follow a nice smooth bell curve?\nThe answer is: basically, yes! Thanks to the central limit theorem, the mean of a sample will approximate a normal distribution as long as the sample is sufficiently large. And what is sufficiently large? The rule of thumb for statisticians is around 30, based on empirical observation. Let’s see how that looks.\nI created a small function in R that calculates the profit or loss after 30 bets at 2.0 (i.e. even money). Then, I wrote a second function that simulated the 30 bets 10,000 times and plotted a histogram of the outcomes.\n\n\n\nAs promised, after only 30 bets we can see that the distribution of the mean outcome resembles a beautiful bell shape.\nBut that’s for the easy scenario where we are betting at even money. What about a more skewed distribution? I changed the odds to 5.0, perhaps betting on away underdogs in football matches. Here is how the distribution looks after 30 bets:\n\n\n\nSo you can see that even with odds of 5.0, after 30 bets the overall distribution is fairly close to normal - certainly close enough to be robust to statistical tests.\nIf we move to more extreme lopsided distributions, that’s when the sample size of 30 becomes too small. Here I demonstrate 30 bets at odds of 20.0, maybe betting on horses, or golfers to win a tournament:\n\n\n\nThe distribution is now skewed to the right. Clearly your maximum loss is capped at 30 units, but profits of greater than 30 are quite feasible if 3 or 4 winners come in. So it would not be appropriate to use a normal distribution to represent these 30 bets. But if we increase the number of bets to 100 at the same odds, then we start to see the normal distribution shape emerge.\n\n\n\nSo generally speaking, it should be fine to use a normal distribution to represent the range of outcomes one might reasonably expect from a series of independent bets, as long as you have a sample of around 30 bets or more."

    "section": "A real life example from my betting",
    "text": "A real life example from my betting\nSo far, I have just been giving hypothetical examples where the odds are the same for every bet. You could actually use the binomial distribution if that were the case, but in reality you are going to have lots of different prices and stake sizes in your ledger.\nBecause each bet is an independent Bernoulli event (it wins or it loses), it is simple to calculate the expected variance for each bet. And a great property of variance is that the variance of a sum of variables is simply the sum of the variance of each variable! So that makes it simple to create a normal distribution curve from any set of bets.\nHere’s a real life example from a football system I was testing for small stakes. This is something I strongly advise any time you think you have found something: test it with real money! Back-testing or paper trading is one thing, but there is no substitute for actually getting real money down. Just be sensible, of course - there’s no need to lose an uncomfortable amount while testing out a new method.\nBelow are the results after 405 bets. I had staked over £29,000 in total, which may sound like a lot but it is less than £100 per bet. At that bet size, a profit of £2,824 from a large number of bets would certainly get you excited! The return on investment (ROI) is 9.58%, though personally I’ve always found ROI to be misleading and limited when it comes to measuring betting performance.\n\n\n\n\nTotal number of bets\n\n\n405\n\n\n\n\nTotal staked\n\n\n£29,495.07\n\n\n\n\nTotal profit\n\n\n£2,824.24\n\n\n\n\nROI\n\n\n9.58%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuffice to say, I was feeling pretty excited about this system. I really thought I had found something! And you can see from the dashed line, these results are closer to the centre of the “my price” curve than the market price curve.\nHowever, there is still enough overlap with the right tail of the market price curve to suggest that this run of results could all just be good luck. In fact the probability is around 8% that one will be at least this far in profit when one has no edge. And…that’s exactly what came to pass. Here are my results after 830 bets:\n\n\n\n\nTotal number of bets\n\n\n830\n\n\n\n\nTotal staked\n\n\n£61,279.54\n\n\n\n\nTotal profit\n\n\n-£413.36\n\n\n\n\nROI\n\n\n-0.67%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLo and behold, I ended up almost smack on the expected return assuming the market price is correct. (Note that this is slightly below zero as it was on an exchange, so commission is factored in).\nI actually still quite like the system in question, but it needs some development. And that’s another great thing about deploying your bets to small stakes: even if it doesn’t make money, you tend to learn something. Humans are great learners, and just being active in the market will give you a feel for all sorts of nuances that are hard to gauge otherwise."

    "text": "In summary\nKeep a record of all your bets and include your estimate of the true price for every bet. Even after 100 or more bets, variance plays a large role in your overall profit & loss, so don’t get too excited about any successes, and don’t give up on a losing system too quickly.\nFinally, there is one way to combat variance by using variance reduction methods. For example, if betting on football, one might use expected goals (xG) to derive the post-match expected win % for each team instead of the binary 1/0 result. Because expected wins have less variance than actual wins, the curves will be narrower and will diverge more quickly.\nI would urge a fair amount of caution though - ultimately it’s results we are betting on, and if there is some element of winning a football match that is not captured by xG…well, that could be an edge in itself!\n\nI welcome feedback!

    "text": "The new Champions League format is in its second season. I’d say the verdict so far is: not perfect, but better than the old format. I’ll talk a bit more about the pros and cons of the new format later, but first let’s try and pick apart the incredibly bunched league table with one game remaining, including a ridiculous eight teams tied on 13 points.\nI simulated the final set of matches using Pinnacle’s current lines for each match. Simulation can be tricky to use appropriately and is perhaps overused at times in football analysis, but in this case it is fairly simple: there is only one game left, and the changes in team ratings after this game or further down the line are irrelevant. There is a small case to be made that the games are not independent - a team might play differently near the end based on other scores - but we will have to ignore that unless someone wants to build a ridiculously complex minute-by-minute state model just for some incremental gains.\nSo here we go.

The next 14 teams are competing for six more places in the top eight, while at the bottom end only four teams are completely eliminated. It’s up for grabs!\nFocusing on the English teams, Arsenal, as mentioned, have secured a bye and are assured of home advantage in all second legs by virtue of a top-2 finish. Liverpool have a 95.8% chance of making the top eight, largely thanks to a friendly last fixture at home to Qarabag.\nTottenham have somehow found themselves in 5th place, having won all four home CL games in a campaign in which they only have two home wins from 11 league matches. Is this a reflection of the Premier League’s current level of dominance? Or maybe a different mental switch Spurs are able to turn on in Europe? Either way, with a trip to already-eliminated Eintracht Frankfurt in the final game, Spurs are given a 56.9% chance of making the top eight.\nDespite currently occupying 7th position, Newcastle are only rated a 14.7% chance to secure a bye because they face PSG away in their last game, almost certainly needing a win. Chelsea likewise are currently in the top eight and yet more likely expected to finish lower: their probability of a top eight finish is down at 35% as they face a tricky trip to Antonio Conte’s Napoli next week.\nRounding out the English teams we have Manchester City who, despite being in 11th place and the lowest of the six English sides, finished in the top eight in 65.8% of simulations! City are strong favourites for their final game at home to Galatasaray, and are helped by the teams above them either having difficult fixtures or playing against each other. It seems like some of the bookies are dangling 1.8 for City to finish in the top eight which is pretty good value in my opinion, for people who are into that sort of thing.\nFor Liverpool, Tottenham, and Newcastle thanks to their goal difference, the brief is simple: win and you’re in. But what if they don’t win? What are their chances? And what about Chelsea and City? The following table shows the probability of each team reaching the top eight conditional upon their result in the final match.\nChampions League 2025-2026 Top 8 Finish Probability\n\n\nConditional on result in final game\n\n\nTeam\nWin\nDraw\nLoss\n\n\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n100.0%\n20.5%\n4.1%\n\n\nNewcastle United\n100.0%\n2.2%\n0.0%\n\n\nLiverpool\n100.0%\n77.6%\n15.6%\n\n\nChelsea\n89.3%\n1.0%\n0.0%\n\n\nManchester City\n80.3%\n0.4%\n0.0%\nNewcastle probably have the simplest agenda: they need to win in Paris (good luck with that) otherwise they have about a one in 50 chance of making the top eight. Spurs probably need a win, but 20.5% of the time after a draw in Frankfurt they still scrape home. Liverpool, if they somehow can’t beat Qarabag at Anfield, still have the cushion of a draw being enough 77.6% of the time.\nFor Chelsea, a win gives them a 89.3% chance, but that will be a tall order in Naples. Finally, Man City are only 80.3% likely to be in the top eight after a win, but given that they are 1/4 pokes against Galatasaray, that still makes them closer to 1.5 than the bookies’ 1.8 (just saying!).\nSomething else I was able to monitor was the median 8th-placed team from all the simulations: this ended up as 16 points and a +6 goal difference; incredibly close to last year’s league phase when Aston Villa finished in 8th place on 16 points with a +7 goal difference!\nIn more than 80% of simulations 16 points were required for 8th spot. There is a small-but-not-zero chance that 13 points could be enough, but that would take an absurd set of results.\nIn addition, I looked at the percentage of simulations where it came down to goal difference - in other words, where the teams in 8th and 9th were on the same number of points. The answer? 67%. So it’s definitely going to be squeaky bum time for a few teams next Wednesday."

    "text": "Thoughts on the format\nAs for my views on the format. First and foremost, let’s be honest, this is a continuation of the descent into low-jeopardy slop that is plaguing many sports nowadays. Perhaps the worst example is basketball’s NBA where they play an 82-game regular season after which 16 of 30 teams still get into the playoffs, and even then they play a best-of-seven series for each round. The Americans truly know how to squeeze all the juice out of the orange.\nUndoubtedly a downside of the new Champions League format is that an early defeat or two is not terminal. 24 out of 36 teams going through is pretty outrageous, to be honest, after making everyone play eight midweek matches alongside their domestic campaigns.\nOne thing I do like is the extra variety of opponents. While the four-team groups in theory created some more tension by playing the same teams home & away, the rivalries just aren’t the same when you are playing teams from another country. The fixture list is far more interesting with eight distinct opponents instead of three.\nA problem we do seem to have at the moment is because of the rule where teams from the same country cannot face each other in the league phase, English teams are getting a double advantage: they are already the strongest teams because of their large revenue, and then they get easier fixtures because they don’t have to play one another!\nBut why should this be the case? Does anyone actually question this rule? Similar to the World Cup wanting to mix continents, I suppose they want to promote mixing between different nations, and it would definitely be a bit silly in the old format if you had three English teams in the same group.\nBut in the new format? Would it really be so bad if Arsenal had two of their league phase matches against, say, Spurs and Liverpool? Those would be pretty epic games! I just don’t really see the downside.\nAnother thing I was pondering is the aspect of the new format for the knockout round where the top two teams from the league phase are guaranteed home advantage in second legs all the way to the final. But because UEFA effectively set up a “bracket”, this means if one of those teams gets knocked out, their opponent secures that home advantage. A fair reward, one might say, until you realise that the team finishing 3rd cannot possible get home advantage for the semi-finals, whereas a team who finished much further down the table can.\nIn the World Cup a pre-determined bracket makes sense, because they are trying to squeeze the whole tournament into one month and have to control the order of games in each round. But in the Champions League there is no reason why they can’t have a random draw each round as they used to do - it was an exciting aspect of the tournament! At the very least they could do a reseeding each round to continue rewarding the team that finished highest.\nOverall though, like most competitions, it’s just good to get past the early grind and into the meat of the tournament. And there is no separation of teams from the same country after the league phase, so with perhaps five or six English teams going into the round of 16, we should have some cracking ties to look forward to.\n\nData Sources\nI gather match data from a variety of public sources.

    "title": "Building a model to simulate football scores from Elo ratings",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I demonstrate how the Poisson and negative binomial distributions compare to actual football scores from the English top flight, and how we can convert Elo ratings into correct score probabilities.\n\n\nBackground\nI hope you enjoyed my recent article looking at the worst league title collapses in English football history. If not, you can read it here.\nNow I will go into a little more depth on the model I used to simulate scores using daily Elo ratings from Club Elo. You can find all my code and data files for this project in my GitHub repo.\nSince the Elo ratings only begin in 1940, we will have to ignore results prior to World War Two. Our first task, as always, is to do some data inspection.\n\n\nHow Football Has Changed Since 1946\nFirst, let’s look at the changes in goalscoring rate through the years. Now, I decided not to account for varying goal rates in this model, because it adds a fair amount of complexity and I didn’t think it would be necessary given the task at hand. Nonetheless, it is still interesting to see how the game has changed over the last 80 years, especially the huge decrease in the latter half of the 1960s:\n\n\n\nWe can also take a look at how home supremacy has changed in the English top flight. This has shown a steady downward trend, presumably due to improved travel and accommodation for away sides. Not many teams took their own chef on the road in the 1950s.\nAnd to help answer the question “how much of home advantage is due to the fans?” we can look at the 2021 COVID season, played in empty stadia, where home supremacy dropped to almost zero.\n\n\n\nFinally, we can summarise the mean Elo rating of English top flight teams over the same time period. The overall trend is upward, and it is also notable that the standard deviation (shown by the light blue band) gets wider as time goes on. The spread of team quality in the modern Premier League, as I’m sure you are aware, is much wider than it used to be.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Do Elo Ratings Work?\nNow we can look at the Elo rating system itself. It was originally designed by Arpad Elo to rank chess players, but can be extended to any zero-sum game with two players or teams.\nWhen two teams play against one another, they are effectively gambling a portion of their points, with the better team (according to their Elo ratings) putting more of their points at stake than the inferior team.\nSince the winner gains the same number of points as the loser loses (the definition of ‘zero-sum’), the population of ratings sits around a consistent long-term average - typically 1500, but any arbitrary number can be chosen.\nYou can find a full explanation of how Club Elo calculates its ratings here. There are adjustments for margin of victory, home advantage, and what they call “tilt” (whether a team’s games are higher or lower scoring than average).\nWe can use Club Elo’s formula to calculate the predicted probability for each game in the data, with 0.5 awarded for a draw. Below I have plotted the deciles of teams’ predicted probability to see how they match up with actual results.\n\n\n\nThe plotted points should approximately follow the dashed line but as you can see, Elo seems to overestimate favourites’ chances and underestimate underdogs’ chances.\nTo reiterate, this is when allotting 0.5 points for a draw. I don’t know how it would fare when trying to predict actual win-draw-lose results instead, or if it’s possible to derive that simply from the Elo difference.\nBut that is our next task!\n\n\nGenerating Realistic Football Scores\nClearly if we are going to simulate league tables, we need actual scores rather than just results. And we certainly need some draws and not “half wins”. So how can we simulate realistic football scores?\nNow let me make it clear at this point, I am not breaking any new ground here. There is a large body of work dedicated to the distribution of football scores going back as far as the 1950s. For further reading I recommend Reep, Maher, Dixon-Coles, and others.\nBut I find it useful and educational to try and build these things yourself step by step, so here we go. I promise to try and keep the maths (math for American readers) as light as possible.\n\n\nUseful Probability Distributions\nIn statistics, when we have an event that will happen some random number of times during a time interval, it is common to use the Poisson distribution. Given that we know the average number of goals scored by teams in our dataset (1.42), we can simply plug that into R’s dpois function and it will give us the probability of 0 goals, 1 goal, 2 goals, and so forth.\nThen we can compare these probabilities with the actual observed relative frequency of each score:\n\n\n\nSo what’s going on? Poisson is overpredicting scores of 1, 2 and 3, but underpredicting 0, 4, 5, and all higher scores up to infinity. This is a problem known as overdispersion.\nThe Poisson distribution relies on an assumption that the mean is equal to the variance. In reality, this assumption is often not satisfied.\nIndeed, the variance of our football scores is 1.65 compared to the mean of 1.42. That’s why the actual scores are more spread out (more 0s, more 5s and 6s) compared to the Poisson predictions (more 1s and 2s).\nThis is where the negative binomial distribution comes to our rescue! The negative binomial distribution in its most common form would be used to model things like “if I have a 70% chance of making each free throw, what is the probability that I miss exactly 5 free throws before I make my 10th successful free throw?” Anyone who took a probability class at university will be familiar with fun questions like that.\nBut the negative binomial distribution can also be expressed in a different way to make it very similar to the Poisson distribution, with a mean but also an additional parameter θ which is known (amongst other things) as the dispersion parameter. This allows us to build a Poisson-like distribution but to toggle the shape by changing θ. The two distributions are related - in fact, if you keep increasing θ, the negative binomial gets closer and closer to Poisson.\nBelow I have added the negative binomial distribution (with θ = 10) alongside the Poisson and the actual observed results:\n\n\n\nNot bad! We instantly see that this is a huge improvement over Poisson, and honestly does a pretty good job of fitting the actual observed scores. To demonstrate how increasing θ affects the negative binomial distribution, here is the same plot with θ = 10,000. It is now indistinguishable from the Poisson distribution:\n\n\n\nSo we’re done, right? Just use a negative binomial distribution with θ = 10 to model football scores. Not so simple, I’m afraid! That would be making an assumption that you can generate a score for team A, and then generate a score for team B, as if the two things happen independently. But is that a fair assumption?\n\n\nAre Team Scores Independent?\nTo test that assumption we need to look at the conditional distribution of a team once we know how many goals their opponents have scored:\n\n\n\nSo now we can see there is a problem. When the opponent has scored 0, the distribution underestimates 0. When the opponent has scored 1, the distribution underestimates 1. When the opponent has scored 2, the distribution underestimates 2, and so on.\nWhat this means is, in actual football, there are more draws than would be expected by generating two independent scores. This is not hard to explain: when a game is level, teams will take relatively fewer risks. When a team is trailing by one goal, they will throw men forward and make the game more open in pursuit of an equaliser. So the overall effect is that final scores are slightly more likely to be draws.\n\n\nAccounting for Team Strength\nWe also have another problem that we haven’t addressed yet. We are generating scores for an aggregate of all teams in our dataset. But teams’ abilities can vary significantly! So we need an algorithm that gives us the mean and distribution for one team, based on the difference in the teams’ Elo ratings, and then the mean and distribution for the second team, based not only on the Elo ratings but also on the score of the first team!\nThe simplest way to approach this is by first generating the score of the favourite (i.e. the team with the higher Elo rating after home advantage has been applied). I fit this with a simple quadratic model of the difference in Elo ratings. Below we can see how this compares with the negative binomial with θ = 35. Remember, this is now an aggregation of different predictions across all of the games in the dataset.\n\n\n\nIt’s a good fit. So the favourites at least seem to be sorted, and we can see that the negative binomial with θ = 35 is superior to Poisson.\nBut what about the underdog? It’s slightly more complex to fit the underdog’s mean goals scored because now we have to account for the number of goals scored by the favourite.\nIn addition, I added interaction terms to the quadratic model. What are interactions? A simple way to explain this is, if Real Madrid were playing against Tranmere Rovers and I told you Real Madrid scored 3 goals, would it change your prediction of how many Tranmere scored? Probably not. If I told you Tranmere scored 3? Clearly your estimates for Real Madrid scoring 3+ should increase. That is an interaction between two variables, because the first variable (number of goals scored by the opposition) has a different effect on the outcome depending on a second variable (quality of the opposition).\nSo let’s see how the underdog scores come out, conditional on the goals scored by the favourite:\n\n\n\nClearly there is a problem. I tried a few different values of θ - the above plots are with θ = 5 because that’s a good fit when the favourite scores 0. But it’s a poor fit for the other scores. So what we probably need is a different θ depending on the favourite’s score!\nI trained a function to find the optimal θ for each value of the favourite’s score, and these were the results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFav_Goals\nDispersion\n\n\n\n\n0\n8\n\n\n1\n35\n\n\n2\n61\n\n\n3\n10000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see how the conditional plots look with these fitted dispersions:\n\n\n\nAs Roy Walker would say: “It’s good, but it’s not the one.” So now it’s time to use some brute force. We know that the underdog’s score is more likely to match the favourite’s score, so let’s do exactly that.\n\n\nInflating Draw Probabilities\nI repeated the last optimization, but this time with an extra parameter that inflates the probability of the underdog getting the same score as the favourite. All values were adjusted proportionally to ensure the total probability was still 1, of course. Here are the results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpp_Goals\nDispersion\nInflation\n\n\n\n\n0\n569\n0.093\n\n\n1\n14\n0.050\n\n\n2\n321\n0.009\n\n\n3\n198\n0.006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo when the favourite scores 0, there is a big boost to the probability of the underdog scoring 0. When the favourite scores 1, the effect reduces by almost half. For 2 or more goals, the inflation is minimal.\nNow how does that look in the conditional distribution?\n\n\n\nI’m pretty happy with that overall. The scores seem to track reality quite well, so we can now generate a probability of every scoreline (0-0, 2-1, 3-3, etc) for each game in the dataset and derive probabilities of win-draw-loss for each team. Let’s calibrate our model by comparing these probabilities with the actual results and scores:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deciles track pretty nicely as the dashed line falls inside all the error bars except one. Note that the probabilities are different to the earlier decile plot because that one was using “half wins” when a game was drawn, whereas this plot assumes a draw is not a win (i.e. it is 0, the same as a loss).\nThe W-D-L plot and correct scores plot are close; there just seems to be a stubborn difference in the 1-1 predictions for some reason. But for the task at hand, this should easily be adequate.\n\n\nSummary\nVia this process we have ended up with something similar to the Dixon-Coles model, which uses a Poisson distribution with inflated probabilities of low scores (0-0, 0-1, 1-1, 1-0).\nBy fitting scores conditionally and inflating the probability of draws, we have a system that can generate realistic match outcomes from Elo ratings alone. This forms a solid foundation for simulating league tables and other competitions, although for advanced analysis I would always advise users to be conscious of the GIGO problem.\nThanks for reading, and as I mentioned earlier, you can find all the code relating to this project at my GitHub repo.\n\nData Sources\nI gather match data from a variety of public sources.

    "text": "Aston Villa are having an incredible season. Their first four Premier League games resulted in two points and no goals. They followed that up with a stinker at Sunderland where they struggled to a draw against a team that had 10 men for an hour. At that stage, a relegation battle looked more likely than a European spot - let alone a title challenge.\nAnd then they embarked on a truly absurd run of results: 17 wins from their next 20 games in all competitions, including a sequence of nine consecutive one-goal wins. Villa’s title hopes took a huge blow with the recent 4-1 thrashing at Arsenal, but the fact they were even in the title conversation was a ridiculous turn of events.\nNow, anyone who has taken the slightest glance at the underlying statistics of this year’s Premier League will be aware that Villa have been sustaining a monumental overperformance relative to expected goals (xG). After 20 games, they have the 2nd-most points, joint with Man City, but only the 14th-highest xG.\nPremier League 2025-2026\n\n\n5 Jan, 2026\n\n\nTeam\nPld\nPts\nxG Diff\nGD\n\n\n\n\nArsenal\n20\n48\n21.5\n26\n\n\nManchester City\n20\n42\n15.8\n26\n\n\nAston Villa\n20\n42\n−5.3\n9\n\n\nLiverpool\n20\n34\n8.6\n4\n\n\nChelsea\n20\n31\n6.4\n11\n\n\nManchester United\n20\n31\n9.0\n4\n\n\nBrentford\n20\n30\n4.1\n4\n\n\nSunderland\n20\n30\n−11.4\n2\n\n\nNewcastle United\n20\n29\n6.9\n4\n\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion\n20\n28\n4.1\n3\n\n\nFulham\n20\n28\n−3.3\n-1\n\n\nEverton\n20\n28\n−6.9\n-2\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n20\n27\n−6.3\n4\n\n\nCrystal Palace\n20\n27\n5.5\n-1\n\n\nAFC Bournemouth\n20\n23\n1.3\n-7\n\n\nLeeds United\n20\n22\n0.1\n-7\n\n\nNottingham Forest\n20\n18\n−5.2\n-14\n\n\nWest Ham United\n20\n14\n−14.0\n-20\n\n\nBurnley\n20\n12\n−21.2\n-19\n\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n20\n6\n−9.9\n-26\n\n\n\nxG data from FotMob.\nDepending on your slant, this may be because Unai Emery is a tactical savant who defies the laws of xG, or because Aston Villa have experienced some outrageously good fortune and are due for a big regression to the mean. The truth probably lies somewhere between those two poles, but why should we even care about xG in the first place?\nDespite having been around for more than a decade now, xG continues to suffer from a serious PR problem. In statistical circles you will often hear George Box’s maxim, “all models are wrong, but some are useful”. And this really is an important concept to digest.\nJust because an xG model says a chance was worth 0.4 goals, or that a team had 1.3 goals’ worth of chances during a game, does not make that some sort of ground truth. Probability is an abstract concept. Anyone can watch the game with their eyes and judge that a chance is better, or worse, than the xG model rates it.\nBut is xG useful? That’s really up to you, and whether you find a use for it. One way to judge xG’s usefulness is to look at whether it is predictive."

    "section": "Assessing xG’s predictive power",
    "text": "Assessing xG’s predictive power\nMy dataset for this study used FBRef data from the ‘big five’ European leagues (England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France) in the seasons 2017-2018 to 2024-2025. FBRef uses Opta’s xG model; there are others to choose from, and Python Football Review made a nice comparison. Overall, I don’t sense that the choice of xG model is going to make or break this study.\nTo assess predictive power, I used a snapshot of each team’s points, goal difference (GD), and expected goal difference (xGD) after each game of each season, and predicted their points-per-game (PPG) over the remainder of the season.\nFirst, I fit three simple linear regressions - one using only points, one using only GD, and one using only xGD - and plotted the \\(R^2\\) for each model as the number of games played increases. \\(R^2\\) tells us the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (in this case, PPG over the rest of the season) explained by each model.\n\n SLR = simple linear regression. Big 5 European leagues 2017 to 2025 (2019-2020 Ligue 1 excluded due to COVID-shortened season).\n\nThe lines follow a similar shape: as expected, the predictive power increases as the sample size increases, stabilising after about 10 games. Then it declines after around 23 games, because with fewer games remaining future PPG naturally becomes more noisy.\nYou will notice that xG is consistently above GD, followed by points. If you literally didn’t know anything else about each team, the three measures give a similar approximation for predicting future points, but xG is the best.\nWhat about when we use all three together? I fit a multiple regression model with all three variables, and plotted each variable’s coefficient, standardized to account for the different units of measurement. The results can be seen below. The second plot shows the marginal \\(R^2\\) for each variable in a multiple regression setting - in other words, how much extra information do we get by adding this variable to a simpler model involving only the other two?\n\n MLR = multiple linear regression. Big 5 European leagues 2017 to 2025 (2019-2020 Ligue 1 excluded due to COVID-shortened season).\n\n\n Marginal R² measures the additional proportion of variance explained when the variable is added to the reduced model.\n\nNow we see a more pronounced difference. When the three variables are used in concert, xG is by far the most useful of the three. These results suggest that xG offers some information that the other two variables do not convey.\nThese are simple models of course, and people can (and do!) create far more complex models to assess team strength and predict future performance. But added complexity generally involves diminishing returns, and it is handy to have a simple statistic that can give you a reasonable indication of how good a team is. This is why people tend to use xG as a quick & dirty indicator of which teams have been lucky or unlucky so far each season.\nAnd so we return to Aston Villa. What can we expect from them in the second half of this season? Based on the above, it would be fair to conclude that Villa’s xG (14th place) is a better reflection of how good they are than their league position (3rd place). But what about the Unai Emery factor? Is there some sort of magic in Emery’s tactics that enables his teams to defy the xG gods?"

    "text": "Which managers have historically outperformed xG?\nI used the same dataset (‘Big 5’ leagues, 2017-2018 to 2024-2025), this time also including UEFA competitions, and compared the cumulative xG for each manager with their actual goals, for and against. The following scatterplot compares each manager’s attacking overperformance (x axis) against defensive overperformance (y axis). So the top right quadrant of this plot is the place to be. Bottom left…not so good.\n\n Big 5 European leagues plus UEFA competitions, 2017 to 2025. Overperformance = difference between actual goals and expected goals.\n\nThe names in the desirable upper-right quadrant are certainly some of the names you would identify as elite managers. Interestingly, Pep Guardiola exceeds xG entirely on the attacking end, while Diego Simeone and Carlo Ancelotti tend to excel defensively. To reiterate, this is a measure of goals relative to expected goals; it does not measure whether a team has high or low xG in the first place, although it is obvious that managers in charge of wealthy clubs like Man City or Real Madrid are going to be above average in xG and other measures.\nOne problem with using cumulative scores is it may reward quantity rather than quality. This is why the upper-right quadrant has more outliers, whereas the bottom-left is more bunched: if you are consistently underperforming your xG then it’s unlikely you will continue being employed for a prolonged period of time. To address this, the following plot shows the same measures but standardized to account for the number of games:\n\n Big 5 European leagues plus UEFA competitions, 2017 to 2025. Overperformance = difference between actual goals and expected goals.\n\nThe standardized plot reveals some interesting names in each quadrant - maybe I’ll come back to them in a future article. But this study is about Unai Emery, and you will have noticed that Emery occupies a prominent position in the upper-right quadrant, exceeding his xG in both attack and defence. In terms of total overperformance relative to xG during the study period, Emery sits third:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 managers by total xG overperformance\n\n\nBig 5 leagues plus UEFA competitions, 2017-2025\n\n\nManager\nMatches\nAtt\nDef\nTotal\nper Match\n\n\n\n\nPep Guardiola\n390\n109.2\n0.7\n109.9\n0.28\n\n\nDiego Simeone\n378\n39.0\n68.8\n107.8\n0.29\n\n\nUnai Emery\n359\n59.8\n45.5\n105.3\n0.29\n\n\nCarlo Ancelotti\n341\n29.8\n61.7\n91.5\n0.27\n\n\nErnesto Valverde\n251\n41.0\n45.0\n86.0\n0.34\n\n\nJürgen Klopp\n341\n41.6\n34.6\n76.2\n0.22\n\n\nBruno Génésio\n256\n48.1\n26.5\n74.6\n0.29\n\n\nHansi Flick\n128\n49.4\n14.8\n64.2\n0.50\n\n\nMauricio Pochettino\n224\n44.5\n17.8\n62.3\n0.28\n\n\nMikel Arteta\n258\n42.8\n19.4\n62.2\n0.24\n\n\n\nOverperformance = difference between actual goals and expected goals.

The big names generally manage the richest teams with the best players, and it could end up as a self-fulfilling prophecy if we anoint them as great managers because those players provide an edge at both ends of the pitch.\nNonetheless, it is always reassuring when the consensus best managers such as Guardiola show up highly on a metric, and it is worth adding that while Unai Emery has managed some big clubs (PSG, Arsenal) during the study period, a large chunk of his games have been with Villarreal and Aston Villa.\nTo recap part one, we have shown that xG is a good predictor of future performance, and we have seen that Unai Emery has outperformed his overall xG in previous seasons. In the next part, I will break down Emery’s previous stints by club, and drill down a little bit on where this xG overperformance comes from, including which players have been the hottest finishers under Emery, whether goalkeepers have played a big role, and how Emery teams vary according to game state.\n\nData Sources\nI gather match data from a variety of public sources.

    "text": "I use Python to derive team ratings from Pinnacle Sports Asian handicaps, and visualize how each team’s rating changed throughout the 2024-2025 Premier League season.\nIf I asked you to rank the strength of the 20 Premier League teams, how would you do it? Gut feel? Last year’s table? Goal difference? Elo? xG? Perhaps you’d build a model?\nPersonally, whenever I want a quick ranking of teams or players in a sporting event, I head straight for the betting markets. Specifically, I look at either Betfair or Pinnacle.\nWhy these two? Because they are less restrictive on winning punters, which means their odds carry more useful information. The sharpest punters in the world, with very deep pockets, have pushed and pulled each price until it reflects their information.\nI thought it would be interesting to see how the betting markets’ ratings for each of the Premier League teams evolved throughout last season. For this task, I used Pinnacle’s odds because historical closing lines are archived on the wonderful Football-Data website."

    "text": "Python optimisation algorithm\nUsing Python, I estimated rolling team ratings from Pinnacle’s Asian handicap markets. Here’s how it works:\n\nRatings are calculated for all 20 teams on any match day of the 2024-2025 season.\nPinnacle’s Asian handicap line is used as the rating for each match (with an adjustment based on the odds).\nA single, season‑wide home advantage is set as the mean of odds‑adjusted handicaps.\nFor each match date, teams playing that day use prev/current/next fixtures (3). Teams not playing use prev/next (2). First and last matchdays are not rated.\nMinimise the squared error between (home_rating − away_rating + H) and the odds‑adjusted handicap.\nFinal ratings are normalized to ensure a mean of zero.\n\nHere is how the ratings look over the course of the 2024-2025 season. I added LOESS smoothing to reduce noise and make the plot more readable:\n  \nI did try to stick to team colours, but it soon becomes unreadable when multiple teams play in the same colour. Honestly it is amazing how many football teams play in red! I don’t know why that is the case - maybe some attachment to red during the Victorian era when clubs were formed? Anyway, I’m sorry to Brentford fans that you ended up as lime green."

    "title": "How did bookmakers rate each Premier League team across the 2024-2025 season?",
    "section": "Man City’s decline",
    "text": "Man City’s decline\nAs for the ratings: firstly we can look at the start of the season, and remind ourselves that Manchester City were still considered a class above the rest when the season kicked off, rated +1.61, more than half a goal ahead of Arsenal and Liverpool.\nCity had won the last 4 titles, and 6 of the last 7. It’s pretty easy to connect their decline last season to Rodri’s ACL injury, and we can see that City’s rating steadily got worse throughout the season, dipping as low as +0.62 before rallying at the end.\nNow, I would introduce a note of caution with regards to ratings near the end of the season. Ratings are based on the odds for each individual match, and in the final few weeks there can be vast disparities in motivation between teams. While City had some must-win matches for Champions League qualification, many other teams in the league had no such incentive since the title and relegation places were all decided relatively early. And certain teams, most notably Tottenham, had evidently prioritised cup competitions.\nSpeaking of Spurs, we can see that in November they were still rated +0.51 and considered a team worthy of a Champions League finish. Indeed, they had some good results around this time, putting 4 goals past West Ham, Aston Villa and Man City, but were struggling with consistency. A horrendous injury crisis then led to a loss of form and confidence, and a subsequent shift of focus to the Europa League, which they won, but their rating had declined by more than a full goal by the season’s end.\nIt was a somewhat similar tale for Manchester United, whose rating opened at +0.46 and closed at -0.46. Despite the loss of revenue as a result of the defeat to Spurs in the Europa League final, United have conjured another huge amount of money to buy new forwards over the summer, and it will be fascinating to see whether these two teams perform like “big 6” clubs, or more like they were rated in May: 16th and 17th in the Premier League.\nThe other notable decline was from Southampton. Obviously it was an appalling season for the Saints - one of the all-time worst PL seasons in fact, as they secured only 12 points. But it’s easy to forget that they actually came up looking like the most likely to survive of the three promoted teams. At the start of the season, Southampton were rated at -0.69 compared to Ipswich at -1.10 and Leicester -1.12.\nThings quickly went downhill, and Southampton’s struggles emphasise the difficulty of sustaining a front-foot, possession-based strategy when transitioning from the Championship into a league where you are going to be playing against vastly superior talent."

    "section": "On the rise: Newcastle, Aston Villa, Bournemouth et al.",
    "text": "On the rise: Newcastle, Aston Villa, Bournemouth et al.\nOn the flip side, there were numerous teams that improved as the season wore on, relative to their ratings in August. Newcastle and Aston Villa were both considered outsiders for a Champions League place, and the Geordies clearly benefitted from an absence of European football that had proved such a burden the previous season.\nVilla, meanwhile, were distracted by their own run to the Champions League quarter-finals, and it is notable that their form picked up in the second half of the season after the slog of the newly expanded league phase was over. In fact, Villa ended the season with a rating of +0.68 which put them marginally ahead of Arsenal in third place. That rating is partly helped by a fortuitous fixture list which gave them both Europa League finalists Spurs and Manchester United in their final two games, and they will be desperately disappointed to have been well-beaten by the latter in their crucial last game.\nOne of the great success stories in recent seasons has been Bournemouth, whose stock rose steadily throughout the season. The Cherries were rated as genuine European contenders (+0.42) at the season’s end, and it will be interesting to see how they can withstand the loss of key defenders Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi and Milos Kerkez, all of whom have been picked off by European giants.\nInterestingly, despite spending much of the season in the top four, Nottingham Forest were never rated higher than mid-table, peaking at +0.05 in February. This is a good example of the cold-headed realism markets offer, while fans and TV pundits can be prone to hyperbole when they don’t have money on the line.\nOne pattern that emerges is a more compressed league by the end of the season. Arguably that is partly down to Liverpool and Arsenal easing off after the title had been decided. But it is also because the smaller teams that might traditionally struggle, like Bournemouth, Fulham and Brentford, all surpassed expectations."

    "text": "Good luck to Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland\nThe bleak outlook for promoted teams has been well documented, and normally there are a few teams who narrowly escaped the drop the previous year who may be vulnerable. But with Wolves and Everton also improving after managerial changes, there is a lack of obvious candidates to go down from last year’s 17. I’m sure some will mention Spurs or United for banter purposes, but realistically if any of the new boys are going to survive, it will be because one of the smaller clubs has an unexpectedly bad year, perhaps because of injuries they don’t have the depth to withstand."

But when I scratched beneath the surface, their 1961-1962 win emerges as one of the more fascinating and unexpected championships in football league history.\n\n Ipswich Town 1961-1962. They may look like Al Capone’s henchmen, but these guys were champions of England.\n\nAt the time, Burnley were a true force in English football, having won the league in 1960 and in the midst of a run of 12 consecutive top half finishes. The dominant team of the era were Bill Nicholson’s Spurs, coming off a historic league & cup double the previous season, and this year reaching the European Cup semi-final where they would lose to Benfica.\nThere was also an emerging Everton side who were about to embark on a 10-year stretch where they won two league titles and finished outside the top 6 only once.\nIpswich, meanwhile, were playing in the top flight for the first time in the club’s history under manager Alf Ramsey, a former Spurs right back who learned his trade under Arthur Rowe in Tottenham’s influential “push and run” champions of 1951.\nDespite trailing by a point, on the 14th of April Burnley had two games in hand and as the strongest team were still considered 80% favourites, with the next two games at home to Lancashire rivals Blackburn and Blackpool.\n\n Division One Table on 14 April 1962 (42-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGA\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nIpswich Town\n\n\n38\n\n\n84\n\n\n63\n\n\n1.33\n\n\n50\n\n\n1679\n\n\n19.4\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBurnley\n\n\n36\n\n\n97\n\n\n58\n\n\n1.67\n\n\n49\n\n\n1753\n\n\n80.3\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n37\n\n\n72\n\n\n47\n\n\n1.53\n\n\n43\n\n\n1691\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n36\n\n\n75\n\n\n61\n\n\n1.23\n\n\n43\n\n\n1733\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nSheffield United\n\n\n38\n\n\n56\n\n\n64\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n43\n\n\n1628\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAston Villa\n\n\n37\n\n\n50\n\n\n46\n\n\n1.09\n\n\n39\n\n\n1649\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith 6 games to go, Burnley were the best team, with the best goal average, and two games in hand.\n\nOne thing this model doesn’t account for is fixture congestion.

Ipswich would end the season in 17th place and then were relegated rock bottom a year later.\nBut this was far from the end of the good times in Suffolk – a decade later, another future England manager named Bobby Robson would oversee a more sustained period of success including an FA Cup, UEFA Cup and league finishes of 4th, 4th, 3rd, 3rd, 3rd, 2nd, 2nd…but not 1st."

    "text": "4. Manchester United 1991-1992 (Probability: 80.9%)\nThe 1991-1992 season is often seen as the final year of the old era due to the impending rebrand of Football League Division One to the Premier League. But it was also the final year of Manchester United’s long league title drought since the days of Charlton, Best, and Law in 1967.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, of course, United’s late collapse in 1992 is a mere footnote beneath the outrageous success of the Alex Ferguson era. But what a collapse it was!\nAs the previous year’s champions Arsenal had mounted a disappointing defence of their title and perennial powerhouses Liverpool declined under the disastrous reign of Graeme Souness, the Red Devils found themselves in a commanding position on the 16th of April, two points clear of Leeds United with a game in hand.\nLeeds had only been promoted two years beforehand but had finished a creditable 4th in the previous campaign, and boasted one of those great midfields that is still easy to rattle off today: Speed, McAllister, Batty, Strachan.

Still recovering from the disastrous Hicks-Gillett ownership era, the Reds had only finished 7th, 6th, 8th, and 7th in the previous four campaigns.\nBut Liverpool had a few things that clicked together this year. Thanks to a lack of European football and early domestic cup exits away to Arsenal and Man Utd, Brendan Rodgers’ side only played 43 matches all season compared to 57 each for Man City and Chelsea.\nAnd up front, the emergence of teenager Raheem Sterling alongside Daniel Sturridge and the genuinely world class performances of Luis Suarez electrified a forward line that had until recently included £35m flop Andy Carroll.\n\n Premier League Table on 20 April 2014 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n35\n\n\n96\n\n\n44\n\n\n+52\n\n\n80\n\n\n1916\n\n\n82.2\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n35\n\n\n67\n\n\n26\n\n\n+41\n\n\n75\n\n\n1944\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n33\n\n\n88\n\n\n34\n\n\n+54\n\n\n71\n\n\n1949\n\n\n14.2\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n35\n\n\n62\n\n\n41\n\n\n+21\n\n\n70\n\n\n1850\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n35\n\n\n57\n\n\n34\n\n\n+23\n\n\n69\n\n\n1836\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n35\n\n\n51\n\n\n49\n\n\n+2\n\n\n63\n\n\n1803\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool closed in on 100 goals and the title.\n\nFollowing the epic 3-2 win over Man City and an away victory at Norwich by the same score, Liverpool found themselves five points clear of Chelsea and nine clear of City. The model gave them an 82% probability of lifting a first league title since 1990.\nIt would require seven points from the final three games to guarantee the championship, and Liverpool’s prospects were further improved by the fact that Chelsea, with only slim odds of the title themselves and preparing for a crucial Champions League semi-final second leg against Atletico Madrid, decided to rest several key players for the Anfield clash on 27 April (ironically, one of the backups who played as a result was a certain Mohamed Salah).\n\nPremier League Title Race 2013-2014  Liverpool’s defeat to Chelsea was a huge blow, but City’s win at Everton was equally pivotal.\n\nAlas, a Mourinho defensive masterclass ensued, and the surprising 0-2 defeat to Chelsea, including the now infamous slip by Steven Gerrard to gift Demba Ba the opener, sent Liverpool’s odds crashing from 80% to 48%.\n\n One of the iconic Premier League moments.\n\nEqually shocking was the 3-3 draw away to Crystal Palace from a commanding 3-0 lead late on, but perhaps one of the more overlooked results of this stretch was City’s 3-2 victory away to a strong Everton side who finished on 72 points under Roberto Martinez - still their highest total since winning the league themselves in 1987.\nThis win improved City’s title probability by more than 30% - almost the same impact as Liverpool’s loss to Chelsea, but the latter is remembered as being far more decisive.\n\nFinal Premier League Table 2013-2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n102\n\n\n37\n\n\n+65\n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n38\n\n\n101\n\n\n50\n\n\n+51\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n38\n\n\n71\n\n\n27\n\n\n+44\n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n68\n\n\n41\n\n\n+27\n\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nEverton\n\n\n38\n\n\n61\n\n\n39\n\n\n+22\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n55\n\n\n51\n\n\n+4\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, a defence that conceded 50 goals wasn’t quite good enough.\n\nCity closed out the title with routine home wins against Aston Villa and West Ham, and a 4th league championship for the club was secured (they now have ten!).\nMeanwhile, Liverpool would have to continue the wait for #19, and Steven Gerrard ended his otherwise fantastic career with none.

The Hillsborough disaster is obviously one, and the other is the climactic final game that is unlikely to ever be surpassed.\nOf course, the events at Hillsborough had an enormous effect on Liverpool’s end to this season – not just emotionally, but the task of playing 8 games in May to make up for postponements.\n\n Division One Table on 6 May 1989 (38-game season) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\nElo\n\n\nWin %\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n35\n\n\n68\n\n\n32\n\n\n+36\n\n\n72\n\n\n1840\n\n\n74.8\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nLiverpool\n\n\n33\n\n\n55\n\n\n24\n\n\n+31\n\n\n64\n\n\n1904\n\n\n25.2\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nNorwich City\n\n\n36\n\n\n46\n\n\n42\n\n\n+4\n\n\n61\n\n\n1715\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nNottingham Forest\n\n\n34\n\n\n57\n\n\n38\n\n\n+19\n\n\n60\n\n\n1819\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n37\n\n\n60\n\n\n45\n\n\n+15\n\n\n57\n\n\n1752\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nDerby County\n\n\n35\n\n\n38\n\n\n33\n\n\n+5\n\n\n55\n\n\n1697\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal were in command of the table as Liverpool dealt with the aftermath of Hillsborough.\n\nIt was actually Arsenal, built around young academy products Tony Adams, Paul Merson, David Rocastle and Michael Thomas, who initially looked like they had blown their chance.

If there’s one thing we can learn about teams who blow titles, it’s that the most successful clubs are going to be the ones who give themselves lots of opportunities to mess it up.\nWe’ve covered United’s 1992 collapse, and it feels appropriate to end with 2012 as those two years nicely bookend the dominant Ferguson era.\nI remember watching City fans doing the Poznan during their 6-1 win at Old Trafford and thinking “good for them” - some payback for a lifetime of sitting through garbage while their local rivals win everything. These feelings quickly wore off of course when Abu Dhabi’s billions started hoovering up trophies on an annual basis. But it did feel fresh for a short time.\nThe dramatic nature of Sergio Aguero’s injury time winner in the final game has perhaps allowed many of us to forget just what a commanding position United had allowed to slip away.

A Yaya Toure brace secured the points, and it now seemed like almost a formality that City would beat relegation-threatened QPR in the final game to seal the league.\nBut football can be unpredictable, and QPR found themselves 2-1 up going into injury time, after Joey Barton was sent off and had a meltdown that would result in a 12 match ban.\nUnited did their part, winning at Sunderland, and you all know what happened next of course, with Dzeko equalizing and then Aguero driving home the winner to provoke wild scenes at the Etihad Stadium.\nRemarkably, this means that United’s title-winning probability dropped from 95% to 12%, then back up in the 90s with City trailing, and finally back to zero.

Eventually the relationship was repaired sufficiently for Tevez to return and start the final six games of the season, City winning all six.\n\nFinal Premier League Table 2011-2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nPld\n\n\nF\n\n\nA\n\n\nGD\n\n\nPts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nManchester City\n\n\n38\n\n\n93\n\n\n29\n\n\n+64\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nManchester United\n\n\n38\n\n\n89\n\n\n33\n\n\n+56\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nArsenal\n\n\n38\n\n\n74\n\n\n49\n\n\n+25\n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\n\n38\n\n\n66\n\n\n41\n\n\n+25\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nNewcastle United\n\n\n38\n\n\n56\n\n\n51\n\n\n+5\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nChelsea\n\n\n38\n\n\n65\n\n\n46\n\n\n+19\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan City’s name at the top was an unusual sight in those days.\n\nAnd so City won the title on goal difference, the only time that has happened in the Premier League era. That 6-1 win certainly came in handy. Fergie signed off with one more championship the following year before retiring, and for United it’s been downhill ever since."
