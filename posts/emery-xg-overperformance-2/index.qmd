Recap of part one with link.

Introduce part two questions. 

Emery by club (show with and without Emery stats).

Player finishing.

Goalkeeper psxG.

Emery by game state versus all by game state.

Mixed effects regression model.

GD to PPG model (linear).

Emery versus predicted points.

Emery scoreline distribution.

Conclusion: Exceeding xG yes, exceeding GD no. Players, maybe. Introduce next part: How predictive is this? Build a model respecting chronology, and validate by using it to predict xG overperformance this season.
