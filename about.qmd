# About Me

<img src="images/jk_headshot_20250701.jpg" alt="John Knight" style="width:140px; border-radius: 50%; margin-bottom: 1rem;">


I currently work as a data analyst in healthcare research. I have a BS in Statistics and I am soon to finish my MS in Applied Statistics & Data Science. I am a former professional gambler with a lifelong passion for statistics and sport, in particular football (soccer) and golf. 

I started this website as a place to collate my various projects and models, and write about things I find interesting. Feel free to email me with any questions, comments, or professional opportunities.
