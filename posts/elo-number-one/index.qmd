Structure:

Intro. Clubs that have been champions of Europe. But that doesn't mean they are the best. Example Villa, flukey cunts. 

Introduce Club Elo as a fun and somewhat effective measure. Best in the world? Elo doesn't include South American teams which would have been an interesting debate until recently but not enough crossover.

Dominant eras by country.

Start from #11 Forest...

11. Nottingham Forest

Promoted, League, European Cup, European Cup. Clough. Derby. Leeds. Peter Taylor. Meh, keep it short, has to be one paragraph tops really.

10. Tottenham

You would think 1960s but no! Some great 1980s sides but often undone by heavy schedule/injuries instead of peaking once.

9. Arsenal

Cunts.

8. Aberdeen

Fergie, wow.

7. Everton

Quality in 60s and 80s

6. Celtic

Famous 1967 team but continued being great until 1972

5. Leeds

The great unheralded team of English football.

4. Chelsea

New money

3. Man Utd

Then and now.

2. Man City

New money

1. Liverpool

The best by MILES. Shanks.
